<h2>What is <b>Vernier Go Direct Motion Detector</b>?</h2>
<p>The Go Direct Motion Detector accurately tracks objects as close as 5 inches and as far away as 11 feet.</p>
<p>Go Direct Motion Detector sends short bursts of sound waves from the gold foil of the transducer. These waves fill a cone-shaped area. Go Direct Motion Detector then “listens” for the echo of these sound waves returning to it. The equipment measures how long it takes for the sound waves to make the trip from Go Direct Motion Detector to an object and back. Using this time and the speed of sound in air, the distance to the nearest object is determined. The Go Direct Motion Detector will report the distance to the closest object that produces a really strong echo. It can pick up objects such as chairs and tables in the cone-shaped area.</p>
<p>The Go Direct Motion Detector can collect data about an object's position, velocity and acceleration. When placed in the motion (cart) mode, it focuses on the position of the objects closer to the detector.</p>
<p><em>Did you know that sound travels at different speeds based on the temperature? </em>The Vernier Go Direct Motion sensor has a built-in temperature gauge that automatically adjusts for the difference in the speed of sound in cold and warm locations.</p>

<h2>How Do You Use <b>Vernier Go Direct Motion Detector</b>?</h2>
<p>To use the Vernier Go Direct Motion Detector, you first need to connect it to the Graphic Analysis software program on your device. This allows you to gather the data that is being collected.</p>
<p>To do this, you can connect it through bluetooth or through the USB cable that comes with it.&nbsp; Step by step instructions can be found in the instruction manual in the Quick Links.</p>
<p>The default channel that is active when the sensor is connected is motion. The motion channel is set to measure the distance between the sensor and the nearest object based on the speed of sound at 22°C. This channel measures the motion of a tossed ball, a walking student, or a mass (object) attached to a spring.</p>
<h2>What is <b>Vernier Graphical Analysis</b>?</h2>
<p>Graphical Analysis is a tool used to collect, graph, and analyze data from Vernier sensors. This allows you to visualize the data that is being collected in real time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The software also allows you to add videos next to the data so you can compare how the sensors react while the event is happening. Another feature is after you gather more than one set of data, you can set it so they all appear on one graph, with each one a different color, and compare them all.</p>

<h2>How Do You Use <b>Vernier Graphical Analysis</b>?</h2>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Launch the Vernier Graphical Analysis software program.</li>
<li>Select Sensor Data Collection and connect a sensor (bluetooth or USB).</li>
<li>Click or tap Collect to begin collecting and graphing data.</li>
<li>Click or tap Stop to stop collecting and graphing data.</li>
<li>Click or tap the graph to examine a point of interest. The coordinates of the point are shown.</li>
<li>Click or tap a different point or drag the Examine line to further examine your data. To remove the Examine line, click or tap Delete Examine Tool, displayed next to the line.</li>
<li>Click-and-drag or touch-and-drag across the graph to select a region of data for analysis. The selected region becomes highlighted.</li>
<li>To view Statistics, click or tap Graph Tools, and choose View Statistics. Statistics information is displayed on the graph.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Explore On Your Own</h2>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Set up the equipment for data collection:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Connect the motion detector to your Chromebook, computer, or mobile device and launch Graphical Analysis.</li>
<li>Click Mode to open Data Collection Settings. Set End Collection to 10 s. Click done. Click View options and choose 1 Graph. This will display a graph of position vs. time.</li>
</ul>
<ol type="1" start="2">
<li>Set the motion detector on a table so that there is an open path in front of it. Face the sensor and move around in a lined pattern. For example, walk forward 2 steps. Walk to the right 5 steps, back 2 steps, and to the right 1 space.</li>
<li>Have another person click Collect to start data collection, and follow the directions you wrote in Step 2. NOTE: Be sure to keep your hands at your sides and as still as possible.</li>
