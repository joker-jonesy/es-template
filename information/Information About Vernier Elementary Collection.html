<h2>What is Vernier Go Direct Temperature Probe?</h2>
<p>The Vernier Go Direct Temperature Probe is a sensor that you can use to monitor temperature. It allows you to collect real-time temperature measurements of a single instance or over a period of time. It can connect via Bluetooth or USB connection.</p>
<h2>How Do You Use Vernier Go Direct Temperature Probe?</h2>
<h3>Using the Vernier Go Direct Temperature Probe</h3>
<p>Using the Vernier Go Direct Temperature Probe is really simple. First, connect it to the Graphic Analysis software program on your device. This allows you to gather the data that is being collected.</p>
<p>To do this, you can connect it through Bluetooth or through the USB cable that comes with it.</p>
<p>Step-by-step instructions can be found in the instruction manual in the quick links.</p>
<p>Knowing how to hold the temperature probe is very important when you want accurate temperature readings. The probe, which is the long metal part of the sensor, is the part that measures the temperature as it heats and cools. While taking temperatures, it is important not to accidentally touch the probe with anything else so you can get a correct temperature.</p>
<p>While taking temperatures, the probe itself should be put into or surrounded by what it is measuring.</p>
<p>For example, if I am measuring how much a cup of coffee cools from the time it is poured until the time the cup is finished, I would place the probe directly into the cup of coffee and leave it there.</p>
<p>You will be able to see the change in temperature on the graph in the Graphical Analysis software.</p>
<h2>What is Vernier Graphical Analysis?</h2>
<p>Graphical Analysis is a tool for science students to collect, graph, and analyze data from Vernier sensors. This allows you to visualize the data that is being collected in real time.</p>
<p>The software also allows you to add videos next to the data so you can compare how the sensors react while the event is happening. After you gather more than one set of data, you can set Graphical Analysis so all data sets appear on one graph, with each one a different color, and compare them all.</p>
<h2>How Do You Use Vernier Graphical Analysis?</h2>
<ol>
<li>Launch the Vernier Graphical Analysis software program.</li>
<li>Select Sensor Data Collection and connect a sensor (Bluetooth or USB).</li>
<li>Click or tap Collect to begin collecting and graphing data.</li>
<li>Click or tap Stop to stop collecting and graphing data.</li>
<li>Click or tap the graph to examine a point of interest. The coordinates of the point are shown.</li>
<li>Click or tap a different point or drag the Examine line to further examine your data. To remove the Examine line, click or tap Delete Examine Tool, displayed next to the line.</li>
<li>Click and drag or touch and drag across the graph to select a region of data for analysis. The selected region becomes highlighted.</li>
<li>To view Statistics, click or tap Graph Tools and choose View Statistics. Statistics information is displayed on the graph.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Explore On Your Own</h2>
<p>Practice using the Vernier Go Direct Temperature probe and Vernier Graphical Analysis software program. Collect the temperature of your hand, your partner's hand, and one other person's hand in the room. <em>Was there any big difference between the temperature of your hands?</em></p>
