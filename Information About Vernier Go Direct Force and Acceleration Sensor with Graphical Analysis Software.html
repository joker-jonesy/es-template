<h2>What is <strong>the Vernier Go Direct Force and Acceleration Sensor</strong>?</h2>
<p>The Vernier Go Direct Force and Acceleration Sensor is a powerful scientific tool that unlocks new ways to connect to the physical world. You can measure force as you push and pull, and interact by shaking, spinning, free falling and other movements. Go Direct Force and Acceleration can be used in a variety of experiments.</p>
<p><em>What kind of data would the force sensor show by pulling an object across a surface with it?</em></p>

<h2>How Do You Use <strong>Vernier Go Direct Force and Acceleration Sensor</strong>?</h2>
<p>To use the Vernier Go Direct Force and Acceleration Sensor, you first need to connect it to the Graphic Analysis software program on your device. This allows you to gather the data that is being collected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To do this, you can connect it through Bluetooth or through the USB cable that comes with it.&nbsp; Step by step instructions can be found in the instruction manual in the ‘quick links.’</p>
<p>Knowing how to work the sensor is very important when you want correct readings. There are seven different measurement channels that can be used with this tool. The default channel, or the channel it will always go to unless you change it, is Force. It also has three channels of acceleration and three channels of gyroscope.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The force channel measures pushes and pulls along the main axis of the sensor body. It uses the hook attachment for pulling and the bumper attachment for pushing. Pulls are known as positive forces and pushes are known as negative forces, unless sensor readings are reversed in Graphical Analysis.</p>
<h2><strong>What is </strong><strong>Vernier Graphical Analysis?</strong></h2>
<p>Graphical Analysis is a tool for science students to collect, graph, and analyze data from&nbsp; Vernier sensors. This allows you to visualize the data that is being collected in real time.&nbsp; The software also allows you to add videos next to the data so you can compare how the sensors react while the event is happening. Another feature is after you gather more than one set of data, you can set it so they all appear on one graph, with each one a different color, and compare them all.</p>
<h2><strong>How Do You Use </strong><strong>Vernier Graphical Analysis?</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>Launch the Vernier Graphical Analysis software program.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Select Sensor Data Collection and connect a sensor (Bluetooth or USB).&nbsp;</li>
<li>Click or tap Collect to begin collecting and graphing data.</li>
<li>Click or tap Stop to stop collecting and graphing data.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Click or tap the graph to examine a point of interest. The coordinates of the point are shown.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Click or tap a different point or drag the Examine line to further examine your data. To remove the Examine line, click or tap Delete Examine Tool, displayed next to the line.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Click-and-drag or touch-and-drag across the graph to select a region of data for analysis. The selected region becomes highlighted.&nbsp;</li>
<li>To view Statistics, click or tap Graph Tools, then choose View Statistics. Statistics information is displayed on the graph.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Explore On Your Own</h2>
<ol>
<li>Launch Graphical Analysis. Connect the Force Sensor to your Chromebook, computer, or mobile device.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Click or tap Mode to open Data Collection Settings. Set End Collection to 60 s. Click or tap Done.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Do the following to collect data using the Force Sensor:</li>
<ul>
<li>Look at the screen and click or tap Collect to start data collection.</li>
<li></li>
<li>Push very softly on the hook of the Force Sensor and watch what happens on the graph.</li>
<li>Now, push more forcefully on the hook. Watch how the force changes when you push with more force.</li>
<li>Try pulling very gently on the hook, and then try pulling more forcefully. Watch how the force changes when you pull on the hook.</li>
<li>Click or tap Stop to stop data collection if data collection has not ended.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
