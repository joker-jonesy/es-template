<ul>
<li><strong>Rectangle </strong>- a shape with four sides and four square corners where opposite sides are parallel and the same length</li>
<li><strong>Square </strong>- a shape with four sides and four square corners where opposite sides are parallel and all sides are the same length</li>
<li><strong>Quadrilateral </strong>- a four-sided shape</li>
<li><strong>Angle </strong>- the point where two lines meet</li>
<li><strong>Parallel </strong>- lines that move in the same direction and are always the same distance apart</li>
<li><strong>Partition </strong>- splitting shapes into smaller pieces</li>
</ul>

<p>Polygons are two-dimensional (2D) shapes that are flat. Polygons have straight lines (sides) that create a closed shape. Regular polygons are polygons where all the sides are of equal length and all the angles are the same.</p>
<p>Click on the video to learn more about polygons.</p>

<p><strong>Rectangles</strong> and <strong>squares</strong> are two types of polygons. They are both <strong>quadrilaterals</strong>. This means they have four sides. They also have four square <strong>angles</strong>, or corners. If you look at this rectangle and this square, you can see that every angle is square.</p>

<p><em>What else do you notice about these shapes?</em> Look at their sides. A rectangle has two pairs of opposite sides that are the same length (top and bottom, and left and right). A square has sides that are all the same length. The opposite sides are also <strong>parallel</strong>. This means if you continue the lines of the sides in each direction, they will never intersect, or cross.</p>
<p><em>Did you know that all squares are also rectangles?</em> But, not all rectangles are squares. Squares are also regular polygons because all of their sides are the same length, and all their angles are the same size.</p>

<p>You can <strong>partition</strong>, or separate, rectangles and squares into equal parts (fractions). Look at this rectangle. There is a line in the center partitioning it into two equal parts. Each part is ½ of the whole rectangle. The two halves together make up one whole rectangle.</p>

<p>This rectangle is partitioned into four equal parts. Each part is&nbsp;¼ of the whole rectangle. The four parts together make up one whole rectangle.</p>

<p>You and a friend are sharing an ice cream sandwich. It is in the shape of a rectangle. By partitioning the treat into two equal pieces, you and your friend will each share one half of the ice cream sandwich.</p>
<p>Two brothers share a bedroom. The older brother has a space that is 12 feet by 7 feet. The younger brother has a space that is 12 feet by 5 feet. This does not seem fair. The spaces are not equal. <em>How can the brothers partition the room so that each brother has one half the room?</em> Knowing how to partition shapes has many uses.</p>

<h3>Shapes in Careers</h3>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-8">
<p>You may not think about using shapes in a career. But, lots of professions require people to know their shapes! One of these professions is architecture. Architects design layouts for buildings, structures (such as stadiums), electrical systems, and plumbing. Not only that, but they may also need to use fractions and partitioning to create equally-sized rooms. Similarly, a landscaper may need to use fractions and partitioning to section off areas of a garden or landscape.</p>

<p>Surveyors take exact measurements of land and properties. They use these measurements with other technologies to make maps and charts of an area. This career is related to architecture. Architects and surveyors work together sometimes. They may also work with urban and regional planners. People with these careers rely on surveyors for correct information. They analyze the charts and maps to make sure a new project will work in an area.</p>
