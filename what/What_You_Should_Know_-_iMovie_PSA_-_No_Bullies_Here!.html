<li><strong>Theme </strong>- the purpose or idea behind a video, film, article, or book</li>

<p><img src="../LiftoffChallenges/Digital%20Communications/iMovie/PSA%20-%20No%20Bullies%20Here!/iMovie_Research_Pexels.jpg" alt="undefined" title="undefined" width="143" height="215" style="float: right;">Pre-production involves work that needs to be done before filming begins. This is the time when research is conducted on the topic. <strong>Research</strong> is a search for new information to increase understanding on a chosen topic.</p>
<p>It is very important to find <strong>credible</strong> websites. This means the website is fair and trustworthy. Things to remember:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia is not a credible source.</li>
<li>The information is within the last 2-5 years.</li>
<li>Typically websites that end in .org or .gov are credible.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important for the director to have the following prepared before filming begins:</p>
<ul>
<li>Research on the topic</li>
<li>Calculations to go with the research</li>
<li>A script (if one is needed)</li>
<li>A location</li>
<li>An actor or actors- the number of actors needed will depend on the director</li>
<li>Equipment and props</li>
</ul>

<p>A <strong>public service announcement (PSA)</strong> is information shared with everyone's best interest in mind to raise understanding and create a positive change in how people think or act. Watch this example of a PSA to learn more about what a PSA is exactly.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSw9ypfyWJI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Go Green PSA Example</a></p>
<p>Math can help an audience better understand the message of a PSA and how it impacts more people. By using multiplication and fractions, the impact on larger groups of people can be estimated. You can also estimate the time spent trying to make a change.</p>
<p><strong>Scaling</strong> is the act of changing the size of something. <strong>Fractions</strong> are used as a mathematical way to represent part of a whole number (for example 1/4 which means there is one part out of four parts). <strong>Equivalent fractions</strong> are fractions that have different numerators and denominators but represent fractions of the same value when simplified (for example, 5/15 and 10/30 are equivalent fractions because both fractions are equal to 1/3).</p>
<ul>
<li>When a whole number is multiplied by a fraction less than 1, the answer will be less than the whole number.<br>5 ⋅ 1/2 = 5/2 = 2 1/2</li>
<li>When a whole number is multiplied by a fraction greater than 1, the answer will be greater than the whole number.<br>5 ⋅ 5/2 = 25/2 = 12 1/2</li>
<li>When a whole number is multiplied by a fraction equal to 1, the answer will be equal to the whole number. This is related to finding equivalent fractions.<br>5 ⋅ 2/2 = 10/2 = 5</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is an example, used in Nigel’s research project about bullying, of how multiplication is like resizing (scaling).</p>
<p>Nigel discovers that 1 out of 4 students in his class know someone that has been bullied. If he wants to find out what 5 times as many would be, he can use the concept of multiplication as resizing (scaling) to calculate an educated guess. To find out the part and the whole, Nigel can use what he knows about equivalent fractions to multiply the numerator and denominator by the same number (5).</p>
<p>1/4 ⋅ 5/5 = 5/20</p>
<p>When the original fraction is multiplied by a fraction equal to 1, the answer is equal to the original, but shows a larger scale of people.</p>
<p>Nigel estimates that 5 out of 20 students in his class may know someone that has been bullied.</p>
<p><img src="../LiftoffChallenges/Digital%20Communications/iMovie/PSA%20-%20No%20Bullies%20Here!/iMovie_Sad_Pexels.jpg" alt="undefined" title="undefined" width="289" height="433" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>Now, Nigel finds out that 100 students in the school reported being bullied. He wants to make an educated guess of how many in one class experienced bullying. He decides to multiply by 1/10 because he recognizes that is the same as dividing by 10.</p>
<p>100 ⋅ 1/10 = 100/10 = 10</p>
<p>The whole number is multiplied by a fraction smaller than 1, so Nigel knew the answer would be less than the original whole number.</p>
<p>So, Nigel can estimate that 10 students in each homeroom have reported being bullied.</p>

<p>Next, Nigel finds out that one of his classmates has started a no-bullying campaign around the school. They spent 3 1/2 hours after school creating posters to put up around school then 2 times as much time putting the posters up around the school. Nigel wanted to include this in his presentation to show others that everyone can make a&nbsp; difference if they spend a little time helping.</p>
<p>2 ⋅ 3 1/2 =</p>
<p>2 ⋅ 5/2 = 10/2 = 5</p>
<p>The whole number is multiplied by a fraction larger than 1, so Nigel knew the answer would be larger than the first whole number.</p>
<p><img src="../LiftoffChallenges/Digital%20Communications/iMovie/PSA%20-%20No%20Bullies%20Here!/iMovie_StopBullying_Pixabay.jpg" alt="undefined" title="undefined" width="206" height="206" style="float: right;">Nigel calculated that his classmate spent 5 hours to start up the no-bullying campaign.</p>
<p>Nigel included all of his calculations as further evidence for his research project on bullying. Providing mathematical evidence with research helps the audience understand how much of an impact this topic has on others.</p>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-8">
<p>Production is when the filming takes place.</p>
<p>Things to consider when filming begins:</p>
<ol>
<li>Keep the camera steady and focused.</li>
<li>Check your lighting to get the best quality.</li>
<li>Check the camera shot to see if it is positioned where it is needed.</li>
<li>Check the sound to ensure it is working correctly.</li>
<li>Make every attempt to avoid interruptions when possible.</li>
</ol>

<p>A positive to film editing is the ability to cut interruptions out during post-production.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1bg60dnfq2"><img src="../CLS_Template/HQ%20Templates/CLS%20Icons%20-%20Explore%20-%20Color.png" alt="" title="" style="max-width: 100%;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="25" height="25"> <strong>What is Post-Production?</strong></h2>
<p>Post-production is when the videos are combined for editing to create the entire movie. To avoid losing anything, it is recommended to save and copy all recordings. This is when sound effects, theme, text and more effects can be added to make a film more engaging for its viewers.</p>

<h3><strong>Broadcasters</strong></h3>
<p>Broadcasters conduct research on a specific topic to create a storyline to share with others. Broadcasters create a script to update people about recent events, news, sports, music, or other important information. Broadcasters are also responsible for verifying all data is accurate before presenting it to the public.</p>
<h3><strong>Broadcast Technicians</strong></h3>
<p>Broadcast technicians focus on the quality of the sound and audio within a news station. They monitor the live feed to ensure there are no issues for those watching from home, in stores, or elsewhere. This career can be obtained after a year-long training program and regular advanced training. It is important for broadcast technicians to have an understanding of fractions and scaling to adequately increase or decrease the audio volume without causing an error in the sound quality.</p>
