<p>Comics are information or stories shared through images and short text. Comics are used to provide important information in a quick but fun way. Comics are used to express ideas or information with images. While a majority of comics are meant for entertainment, comics are also a great way to learn about historical events, science, and even math.</p>
<p>Comics can be as long as you want them to be. There are many books that are told in story form. On the other hand, comics can also be very short. If you look in a newspaper, there is a comic section where you can read a number of different stories, comedies, or facts. For this assignment, your comic might be two pages long.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1bg60dnfq2"><img src="../CLS_Template/HQTemplates/CLSIcons-Explore-Color.png" alt="" title="" style="max-width: 100%;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="25" height="25"> How Do I Format My Comic?</h2>
<p>A template is like an outline. It is a premade document. When opened, it is already laid out where all you need to do is input your information. There is a large number of templates that can be used, depending on what you are working on. You can also create your own template by starting on a blank page and creating your own design.</p>
<p>Another part of the template to think about is the layout or format. The layout includes how many comic boxes you will need and the flow they need to go in. It will also include what text bubbles will be used and any larger text that you want added. Overall, it is how everything will be arranged in the comic.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1bg60dnfq2"><img src="../CLS_Template/HQTemplates/CLSIcons-Explore-Color.png" alt="" title="" style="max-width: 100%;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="25" height="25"> What Components Should Be In a Story/Comic?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Characters: Every story needs characters. They do not always have to be human characters. The best thing about stories and comics is that characters can be anything we want them to be, including objects that aren’t even living.</li>
<li>Setting: Where the story takes place sets the tone for the storyline. It gives readers a sense of what is going on around the characters.</li>
<li>Problem: Characters start off with a situation that needs to be solved.</li>
<li>Main Event: This is when something big happens where the problem begins to get solved.</li>
<li>Solution: After a big event happens in a story, they need to solve the problem.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1bg60dnfq2"><img src="../CLS_Template/HQTemplates/CLSIcons-Explore-Color.png" alt="" title="" style="max-width: 100%;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="25" height="25"> How Can You Persuade Others to Agree With Your Opinion?</h2>
<p>Persuading others can be done several different ways. In storytelling, authors can only use words to persuade readers. To persuade someone with words, you have to write detailed facts to draw your readers to your side.</p>
<p>If I wanted to persuade you that a chocolate chip cookie is the best cookie ever, I might describe the cookie as delicious and delicious. I would say that when you break apart a freshly baked chocolate chip cookie, you can see the steam rise and the melted chocolate from the warm chips. The sweet smell from the cookies can make the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end.</p>

<p>Think about what you did in the last day or two. <em>How did you use math?</em> Math is used to measure ingredients to make dinner. It’s used to plan your day so that you arrive on time wherever you go. Math is even used to calculate the cost of making books and comics.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1bg60dnfq2"><img src="../CLS_Template/HQTemplates/CLSIcons-Explore-Color.png" alt="" title="" style="max-width: 100%;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="25" height="25"> Why Do We Need To Learn About Calculating Money?</h2>
<p>When it comes to being paid and paying others, you want to make sure it is the right amount. The most important thing to remember when solving problems with money is that you have to line up the decimal points. Make sure there are only two decimal places after the decimal point. If the amounts are not lined up correctly, you may end up with the wrong total.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>&nbsp; $23.86 <br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">+$12.36</span>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; $36.22</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1bg60dnfq2"><img src="../CLS_Template/HQTemplates/CLSIcons-Explore-Color.png" alt="" title="" style="max-width: 100%;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="25" height="25"> What are Word Problems?</h2>
<p>Word problems are real-life math problems that need to be solved, and they are written in the form of a sentence or a short paragraph. Word problems<strong> </strong>include math operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Multi-step word problems have more than one math operation. Word problems<strong> </strong>can be used to help you find the answer to a real-life math problem.</p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<p>Amanda and Sarah both work at a sandwich shop and make $8.25 an hour. Amanda worked 12 hours this week, and Sarah worked 9 hours. <em>How much more did Amanda make than Sarah?</em></p>
<p>To solve a word problem, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start by thinking about what you know and what you need to know. <br>
<table border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="width: 99.8603%;">
<p>I know…</p>
<ul>
<li>Amanda makes $8.25 for each hour she works.</li>
<li>Sarah makes $8.25 for each hour she works.</li>
<li>Amanda worked 12 hours this week.</li>
<li>Sarah worked 9 hours this week.</li>
<li>To solve the problem, I need to find the difference between how much money Amanda and Sarah made.</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</li>
<li>Then, figure out what you need to know to solve the problem. <br>
<table border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="width: 99.8603%;">To find the difference, I need to know how much money Amanda and Sarah made this week. I need to know how much more money Amanda made than Sarah.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</li>
<li>Next, come up with a plan for how you’re going to solve the problem. <br>
<table border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="width: 99.8603%;">
<p>Because I need to figure out multiple pieces of information to solve the problem, this is a multi-step word problem.</p>
<p><strong>Plan for Solving This Problem</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Find the amount of money Amanda made by multiplying her hourly rate ($8.25 an hour) by the number of hours she worked.</li>
<li>Find the amount of money Sarah made by multiplying her hourly rate ($8.25 an hour) by the number of hours she worked.</li>
<li>Then, subtract the amount Sarah made from the amount that Amanda made.</li>
</ol>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</li>
<li>After that, complete the steps in your plan. <br>
<table border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="width: 99.8603%;">
<p>First, calculate how much money Amanda made.&nbsp;</p>
<p>$8.25 x 12 = $99.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<br>
<table border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="width: 99.8603%;">
<p>Next, calculate how much money Sarah made.</p>
<p>&nbsp;$8.25 x 9 = $74.25.</p>
<p>Last, find the difference by subtracting the amount Sarah made, which is the smaller number, from the amount Amanda made, which is the bigger number.</p>
<p>&nbsp;$99.00<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">-$74.25</span>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;$24.75</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</li>
<li>The final step is to use the information you found to answer the question. <br>
<table border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="width: 99.8603%;">
<p>Amanda and Sarah both work at a sandwich shop and make $8.25 an hour. Amanda worked 12 hours this week, and Sarah worked 9 hours. <em>How much more did Amanda make than Sarah?</em></p>
<p>Amanda made $24.75 more than Sarah.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When you’re solving real-life math problems, you might have to write your own word problem to help you. When you write your own word problem, include two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>The information you know</li>
<li>A question to describe the answer you want to find when you solve the problem</li>
</ul>
<p>See the color-coded example below.</p>
<p>Amanda and Sarah both work at a sandwich shop and make $8.25 an hour. Amanda worked 12 hours this week, and Sarah worked 9 hours. <em>How much more did Amanda make than Sarah? </em></p>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-8">
<p>Many jobs can come from working with comics. You can become an illustrator and even graphic designer.</p>
<h3>Illustrator</h3>
<p>An illustrator is a person who draws the images in comics, books, and cartoons. You would be in charge of reading the story or information and choosing what you want to draw to go with the words. Illustrators use research like you do when you work with comics. They need to research the book they are drawing in order to create designs that fit the story. Your name would be highlighted on the outside of many covers and can be noticed worldwide.</p>

</div>
</div>
<h3>Graphic Designer</h3>
<p>Graphic designers create visuals to go with concepts. Graphic designers design layouts for advertisements, brochures, magazines, and many other creative media. They can use computer programs to create these designs or can even do it by hand. Graphic designers use many skills that are used in making comics. They have to solve word problems to figure out measurements of how much space they have to work with. They have to research the information they are designing for and, of course, they need to persuade people to read and look at their designs.</p>
