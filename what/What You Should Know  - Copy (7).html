<h1>What You Should Know&nbsp;</h1>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1clekuqqj18">What Is an Urban Heat Island?</h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">An urban heat island is an urban area where the temperature is higher than the surrounding rural areas because of the things humans do. Humans build cities with materials that are&nbsp;<strong>impermeable&nbsp;</strong>or material that does not allow water and are to pass through easily such as concrete, asphalt, and metal.&nbsp; Humans also build Buildings and roads typically made out of materials that absorb the sun's energy and radiate that back out as heat replace vegetation. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that on a summer day, urban temperatures can increase by 5 degrees Celsius or 9 degrees Fahrenheit compared to the surrounding rural air temperature because of the characteristics of these materials. The temperature differences between urban and rural areas are most notable at night due to the slow release of heat from city structures.</span></p>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1clekuqqj19">Challenges of Rising Temperatures</h2>
<p><img src="../Liftoff%20Challenges/Sustainability/Energy%20Efficiency/Urban%20Heat%20Islands/blackout_energyefficiency.jpg" alt="blackout in city" title="blackout in city" style="max-width: 100%; float: right;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="285" height="212" /><span style="color: #333333;">When cities are hotter, the demand for air conditioning increases. When we have heat waves with prolonged above average temperatures combined with an already increased temperature in the city due to lack of vegetation, the demand from homes and businesses for cooling can overload the system. When power is being consumed at greater rates than what the system can produce, local governments often&nbsp;respond with planned rolling blackouts where at certain times in certain areas electricity is shut off. Local governments institute&nbsp;rolling blackouts only in the most serious situations to&nbsp;avoid total system shutdowns known as blackouts. Blackouts are unplanned events where the system becomes overloaded and fails. Blackouts are dangerous and can lead to injuries or even death especially for those dependent on electricity like the elderly, infants, and people with health issues.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">In addition to potential energy blackouts from overloading the electrical&nbsp;system, most of our electrical power comes from fossil fuel sources (natural gas, coal, and petroleum). Higher demand on the system means the release of&nbsp;more than normal levels of air pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions. The chemicals released into the air can get trapped in the city and build up, which can cause serious health issues for the sick, young, elderly, and those with respiratory issues.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1clekuqqj1a">Green Buildings&nbsp;</h2>
<p><img src="../Liftoff%20Challenges/Sustainability/Energy%20Efficiency/Urban%20Heat%20Islands/green-roof_energyefficiency.JPG" alt="green roof" title="green roof" style="max-width: 100%; float: right;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="322" height="242" /><span style="color: #333333;">Organizations have been established to help encourage more sustainable building practices. The U.S. Green Building Council created Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) ratings to help encourage greener building practices. Construction companies have begun experimenting with different building materials including more reflective material, lighter colors, and adding more vegetation to increase energy efficiency and lower costs. Green roofs is one of the many designs that have become common in commercial construction because of their&nbsp;ability to help combat the urban heat island effect as well as their&nbsp;increased life span&nbsp;compared to&nbsp;a traditional roofing material&nbsp;and their storm-water management&nbsp;qualities.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1clekuqqj1b">Converting Degrees Fahrenheit to Degrees Celsius</h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Degrees Celsius&nbsp;or the centigrade scale is the international system of measurement of temperature. The centigrade&nbsp;scale is used by all countries in the world except for the United States, Liberia&nbsp;and Myanmar. The system has assigned 0 degrees Celsius to the temperature at which water freezes and 100 degrees Celsius&nbsp;to the temperature at which water boils. To convert Fahrenheit temperature&nbsp;to Celsius temperature or vice versa you can use the equations below.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">&nbsp;<strong><em>f</em>&nbsp;&deg;Fahrenheit to&nbsp;<em>c</em>&nbsp;&deg;Celsius:</strong>&nbsp;(<em>f</em>&nbsp;- 32) &divide; 1.8 =&nbsp;<em>c</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong><em>c</em>&nbsp;&deg;Celsius to&nbsp;<em>f</em>&nbsp;&deg;Fahrenheit:&nbsp;</strong>(<em>c</em>&nbsp; &times; 1.8) + 32 =&nbsp;<em>f</em></span></p>
