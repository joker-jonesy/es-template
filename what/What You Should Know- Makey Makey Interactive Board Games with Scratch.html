<ul>
<li><strong>Mixed Number </strong>- a term consisting of a whole number and a fraction</li>
<li><strong>Fraction </strong>- equal parts of a whole or of a collection</li>
<li><strong>Numerator </strong>- the top number of a fraction that shows how many parts of the whole the fraction is</li>
<li><strong>Denominator </strong>- the bottom number of a fraction that shows the number of equal parts an item is divided into</li>
<li><strong>Equivalent Fractions </strong>- fractions with different numerators and denominators that represent the same value or same portion of the whole</li>
<li><strong>Multiple </strong>- a number that can be divided by another number without a remainder</li>
</ul>

<p>All circuits include three parts:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Power source</strong> (like a battery or solar panel)</li>
<li><strong>Load</strong>, also known as a <strong>resistor</strong> (like a light or motor)</li>
<li><strong>Path</strong> (wire or another conductive material)</li>
</ol>
<p>There are endless ways that circuits can be created and laid out with those three parts. The two main ways that circuits can be laid out, or configured, are <strong>series</strong> and <strong>parallel</strong>.</p>

<p>A <strong>series circuit</strong> is a circuit that is closed but contains more than one <strong>resistor</strong> (more than one lightbulb, motor, buzzer.) When electricity flows through a series circuit the current only travels on one path. If there is a break in the circuit it stops the whole circuit from working. Series circuits also affect the brightness of the bulb. The more resistors you add (LED bulbs), the further the current has to travel and the dimmer the LED bulbs become.</p>

<div class="tab-pane fade" role="tabpanel" tabindex="0">
<p>A <strong>parallel circuit</strong> is a circuit that is closed. Like a series circuit it also contains more than one <strong>resistor</strong> (more than one lightbulb, motor, buzzer.) However, when electricity flows through a parallel circuit the current goes through every component in the circuit and carries the same amount of current to all of the resistors. Parallel circuits do not affect the brightness of each individual LED bulb. An added benefit of parallel circuits is that if one resistor breaks, the others will continue to work because the current has multiple paths it can travel.</p>

<p>In order to find the lowest common denominator (LCD), follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Look at the numbers in the denominators.</li>
<li>List the multiples of these numbers until you find a match.
<ol>
<li>In the example below, the lowest common multiple is 12.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Multiply each numerator and denominator by the same factor that you used to multiply the denominator.
<ol>
<li>You had to multiply the denominator of 3/4 by 3 to get 12. So 3/4 × 3/3 = 9/12</li>
<li>You had to multiply the denominator of 1/3 by 4 to get 12. So 1/3 × 4/4 = 4/12</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<p>To add or subtract fractions with unlike denominators, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find the lowest common denominator (LCD) of each fraction. You can follow the steps above.</li>
<li>Once you have changed the fractions so that they have denominators, you can add or subtract the numerators. 9/12 - 4/12 = 5/12</li>
<li>Simplify the fractions at the end. In this case, 5/12 is in its simplest form.</li>

<p>Makey Makey has a number of "Plug and Play" apps that you can use with the Makey Makey board, but Scratch lets you create your own games and sound effects. When you create a closed circuit with the Makey Makey board, your computer registers that as a click or as if you were pressing an arrow key or space bar.</p>
<p>You can program the output which is the response to the input with Scratch. You decide whether sounds play or the Scratch character moves when a key or button is pressed.</p>
<p><strong>Event Blocks</strong></p>
<p>Scratch uses Event Blocks to tell the computer when to start the program.</p>
<p>Think about it like this: When you knock on your friend's door, they stand up, walk to the door, and open it. The knock on the door is like the Event Block telling your friend to get up and open the door.</p>
<p>In this Scratch example, when the green flag (Event Block) is clicked, it starts the code attached to the Event Block: move 10 steps, start the “Meow'' sound, and then repeat "turn 90 degrees” and “wait 1 second" four times.</p>
<p><img src="../Liftoff%20Challenges/Circuitry/Makey%20Makey/Interactive%20Board%20Games%20with%20Scratch/event-block_makeymakey.png" alt="event block in Scratch" title="event block in Scratch" width="239" height="373" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>Scratch has another Event Block that lets you choose what will start the program. You can start the program by pressing the space button, up arrow, down arrow, left arrow, right arrow, or letter keys.</p>
<p>You can find space, arrow keys, and some of the letters on the Makey Makey board. You can create a closed circuit with your Makey Makey board that will start the Event Block.</p>

<h3>Architect</h3>
<p>Architects design buildings and plans for houses. They add and subtract fractions in order to make precise measurements for their building designs. Being off by 1/8<em>in</em> may not seem like a large distance, but it makes a huge difference when it comes to fitting windows perfectly.</p>
<h3>Baker/Chef</h3>
<p>Bakers and chefs use fractions when developing new recipes. In order to perfect a new recipe, they add or subtract fractional amounts of ingredients. Perhaps the dish would be better with another 1/8 teaspoon of a certain spice.</p>

<h3>Pharmacist</h3>
<p>Pharmacists must use fractions when mixing and measuring medicine to fill patients prescriptions. This is important because patients must take the correct dose of medicine; if they take too little, the medicine may not work, and if they take too much, it could be damaging or even fatal.</p>
