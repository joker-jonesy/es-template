<p>When people design 3D objects using software like Tinkercad, they send their models to a 3D printer. The printer starts with the bottom of the object. It uses hot plastic to build one thin layer at a time, just like a layer cake.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1bg60dnfq2"><img src="../CLS_Template/HQ%20Templates/CLS%20Icons%20-%20Explore%20-%20Color.png" alt="" title="" style="max-width: 100%;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="25" height="25"> <strong>What Is Tinkercad?</strong></h2>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-8">
<p>You can use Tinkercad to create <strong>3D</strong> (three-dimensional) models or drawings of objects that have three dimensions: length, width, and height.</p>
<p>With Tinkercad you can look at your drawing from the side, top, or bottom. You can also shrink or enlarge the drawing.</p>
</div>

<p>The <strong>scale factor</strong> can tell you by how much an object was shrunken or enlarged. If you want to double your model, you can multiply each measurement by a <strong>scale factor</strong> of 2. If you want to reduce your model by half, multiply each measurement by a scale factor of ½.</p>
<p>For example, if you had a cube with measurements of 3 inches for the length, width, and height and you wanted to double the size of the cube, you would multiply each by a scale factor of 2.</p>

<p>With practice, you can create a 3D model of almost anything with Tinkercad!</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1bg60dnfq2"><img src="../CLS_Template/HQ%20Templates/CLS%20Icons%20-%20Explore%20-%20Color.png" alt="" title="" style="max-width: 100%;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="25" height="25"> <strong>To Shrink or to Enlarge?</strong></h2>
<p>Follow these steps to shrink or enlarge an object in Tinkercad:</p>
<ol>
<li>Drag one of the corners of the object.</li>
<li>Find the red box on the lower, right corner of the object you’ve created.</li>
<li>Click on the box and drag it down and to the right to enlarge, or up and to the left to shrink.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="../Liftoff%20Challenges/Computer%20Graphics/Tinkercad/Intro%20to%203D%20Drawing/Tinkercad_Enlarge_CLS.png" alt="enlarge in Tinkercad" title="enlarge in Tinkercad" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%;"></p>
<p>If you want to change the size of your object by a specific measurement, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Multiply each measurement by a scale factor.</li>
<li>Click on the numbers for the length, width, and height, and type in the new measurements.</li>
</ol>
<p>The default unit of measure in Tinkercad is millimeters; keep that in mind when determining your scale factor.</p>
<p>In the example above, the cube has a length, width, and height of 20 mm. If you wanted to shrink the cube by a scale factor of ¼, you would multiply the length, width, and height by ¼:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Length = 20 mm × ¼ = 5 mm</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Width = 20 mm × ¼ = 5 mm</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Height = 20 mm × ¼ = 5 mm</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Once you have calculated the new measurements after applying the scale factor, type them into Tinkercad. Click on the number that represents the measurement and a fill-in box will open. Type your new measurement into the box and Tinkercad will adjust the image for you. Remember to change all three!</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><em>How can you tell if a scale factor would make the object larger or smaller without actually multiplying?</em> Look back at the previous section to help you think about how this can be done.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1bg60dnfq2"><img src="../CLS_Template/HQ%20Templates/CLS%20Icons%20-%20Explore%20-%20Color.png" alt="" title="" style="max-width: 100%;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="25" height="25"> <strong>Converting to Millimeters</strong></h2>
<p>Tinkercad measures in millimeters. “Millimeters” is a measurement of length in the <strong>metric system</strong>, which is a system where the units for length, capacity, and weight get larger or smaller by a power of 10.&nbsp; Refer to the metric conversion chart below to review the decimal place values:</p>
<p><img src="../Liftoff%20Challenges/Computer%20Graphics/Tinkercad/Intro%20to%203D%20Drawing/Tinkercad_MetricConversion_CLS.PNG" alt="metric conversion chart" title="metric conversion chart" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%;"></p>
<p>In the metric system, the meter is the base unit for length; to move from meters to millimeters you need to divide by 10, three times. This is the same as dividing by 1,000.</p>
<p>1 / 1,000</p>
<p>This is read as “one one-thousandth”, and can be written as the decimal, 0.001.</p>
<p><em>What do you notice about the relationship between the denominator of the fraction 11000and the decimal 0.001?</em></p>
<p>To convert to millimeters, you moved to the right on the metric conversion chart above, and so the decimal point slid three places to the left:</p>
<p><img src="../Liftoff%20Challenges/Computer%20Graphics/Tinkercad/Intro%20to%203D%20Drawing/Tinkercad_MtoMM_CLS.png" alt="convert meters to millimeters" title="convert meters to millimeters" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%;"></p>
<p>Remember: there is a decimal point after the number ‘1’, we don’t always write it, though. So 1 is the same as 1.0.</p>
<p>To convert between units of measure in the metric system, the decimal point is moved one place for each power of ten being multiplied or divided.</p>
<p>Scale factors are used a lot in manufacturing. They help with redesigning products while keeping costs down. Manufacturing designers experiment by making changes to a prototype, which is often a scale model. If they are designing something rather large like a jet plane, they would probably make a model that is much smaller than an actual jet plane. Once they figure out a new design that meets their needs, then they mass-produce the product.</p>
<p>Let’s say that you want to change the design of a cereal box. Cereal boxes are typically in the shape of a <strong>rectangular prism</strong> with measurements of 19cm x 28 cm x 7cm. To create a scale model to use as a starting point, you would use scale factors to figure out a new size. Since you know that Tinkercad works in millimeters and not centimeters, you would need to convert the measurements to millimeters to recreate the cereal box in Tinkercad.</p>
<p>If one of the measurements of the cereal box is 19 cm, to convert to mm you need to divide by 10, resulting in the decimal point sliding one point to the right:</p>
<p><img src="../Liftoff%20Challenges/Computer%20Graphics/Tinkercad/Intro%20to%203D%20Drawing/Tinkercad_CMtoMM_CLS.png" alt="convert centimeters to millimeters" title="convert centimeters to millimeters" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>19 cm is equal to 190 mm. To create this rectangular prism in Tinkercad, you would enter the new measurements in the fill-in box, which appears for each measurement when you click on it.</p>

<h3>Scale Factors in Careers</h3>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-8">
<p>Scale factors have many applications in the real world. You may have already applied scale factors if you’ve ever adjusted a recipe, such as to cut it in half or to double it. Professional chefs do these scale factor calculations all the time. When playing a video game, the worlds created in some of the most realistic video games use scale factors to make them look like miniature models of the real world. Computer game designers need to understand scale factors in order to design these environments.</p>

<p>Maps use scale factors to help people calculate actual distances between different places on the map. Land surveyors use maps and special equipment to measure the Earth’s surface each day. Their work helps to refine maps by defining land and water boundaries and mapping out the shape, location, and elevation of different areas of land. Their work is very important for mapping out and planning any new land developments or buildings, as they locate the property boundaries before any work is done. Land owners must know the legal boundaries of their property before they can build on it or sell it. Each day, they help build a picture of what our planet looks like, literally from the ground up!</p>
