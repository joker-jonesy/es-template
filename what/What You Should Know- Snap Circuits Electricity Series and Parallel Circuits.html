<p>Everything in the universe is made of tiny particles called <strong>atoms</strong>. Atoms are too small to see—even with a normal microscope.</p>
<p>Electrons move around the outside of atoms like the moon orbits around the Earth. Electrons have a small negative (-) electrical charge. Protons [which have a small positive (+) charge] and neutrons cluster in the middle part of the atom. This is called the nucleus. In some materials, like in some electrical wires, electrons can easily separate from the rest of the atom.</p>
<p>Think of the old saying, "opposites attract." Electrons in a wire leave their atoms and are "pulled" towards the positive end of the wire.</p>
<p>Electrons can also "push" each other around. They do not want to be near one another. They want to be near their opposites (protons). Electrons are "pulled" to the positive end of the wire, but they also "push" each other in that same direction. They are trying to find the positive charge. This flow of electrons is called an electric <strong>current</strong>. This steady flow is the source of energy that is electricity. Electricity flows from a power source along a wiring path to an electrical device (load), and then back to the power source.</p>

<p>Materials that conduct or transfer electricity are called <strong>conductors</strong>. This means that it is easy for the electrons to flow through them.</p>
<p>Materials that do not conduct electricity are called <strong>insulators</strong>. This means that the electrons are not able to flow and electricity cannot travel through them.</p>

<p>Take a close look at a type of light bulb called the incandescent light bulb. These are the traditional light bulbs widely used today.</p>

<p>Light bulbs depend on an electrical principle called <strong>resistance</strong>.</p>
<p>Electricity is electrons moving from one atom to another. Electrons move easily along the copper electrical wire that typically connects the light to a power source, like a wall outlet or battery.</p>
<p>First, electricity enters the light bulb either through the bottom or side of the screw-in base. It travels up a wire inside of the bulb.</p>
<p>Next, the electricity passes through a part of the bulb called the filament. The filament is a very long and thin coil of wire. It is usually made of a type of metal called tungsten. The electricity continues down the other wire and out the base of the bulb.</p>
<p>What happens in the filament is actually what makes a light bulb so useful.</p>
<p>The filament is so thin (about one-hundredth of an inch) that the electrons are constantly bumping into atoms as they move around. All that bumping around creates enough heat that the filament begins to glow. This is the light we see. When the filament uses up electrical energy and converts it to heat and light, this is the concept of <strong>resistance</strong>.</p>

<em style="font-size: 19px;"><img src="../Liftoff%20Challenges/Circuitry/Snap%20Circuits%20Electricity/Series%20and%20Parallel%20Circuits/clap_snapcircuitselectricity.png" alt="rub hands together" title="rub hands together" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="123" height="95" style="max-width: 100%; float: right;"></em><span style="font-size: 19px;"></span>
<p>Resistance is very important in electrical circuits. Here is a good way to better understand how resistance works in the filament: Rub your hands together quickly. <em>Do you feel them getting warm?</em></p>
<p>Rubbing your hands together changes <em>kinetic energy</em> (the energy of motion) into heat. The filament works in a similar way; it heats up and glows when the moving electrons rub up against each other as they move through.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1bg60dnfq2"><img src="../CLS_Template/HQ%20Templates/CLS%20Icons%20-%20Explore%20-%20Color.png" alt="" title="" style="max-width: 100%;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="25" height="25"> <strong>Perimeter and Area</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Perimeter</strong> is the boundary of a two-dimensional figure and <strong>area</strong> is the space that is enclosed by a two-dimensional figure, such as a rectangle or circle. It is measured in square units (units<sup>2</sup>). You can find the perimeter of a shape and the area of a shape by using the measurements of the shape and a formula.</p>
<p>Area = <em>A </em>=<em> l</em> × <em>w</em></p>
<p>Perimeter =<em> P </em>=<em> l </em>+<em> l </em>+<em> w </em>+<em> w</em></p>
<p>The snap circuit grid you will be using is 9 units by 6 units. To find the area of the grid, use the formula,&nbsp;<em>A </em>=<em> l</em> × <em>w</em> where <em>A</em> is area, <em>l</em> is length, and <em>w</em> is width.</p>
<p>The area of the snap circuit grid can be found by inserting these values for length and width into the formula:</p>
<p><em>A </em>= 9 × 6</p>
<p><em>A </em>= 54 units<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>To find the perimeter, the formula <em>P</em> = <em>l</em> + <em>l</em> + <em>w</em> + <em>w</em> is used. It is also written as</p>
<p><em>P</em> = 2(<em>l) </em>+ 2(<em>w</em>).</p>
<p>The perimeter of the snap circuit grid can be found by substituting the values for length and width into the formula:</p>
<p><em>P </em>= 2(9) + 2(6)</p>
<p><em>P </em>= 18 + 12</p>
<p><em>P </em>= 30 units</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1bg60dnfq2"><img src="../CLS_Template/HQ%20Templates/CLS%20Icons%20-%20Explore%20-%20Color.png" alt="" title="" style="max-width: 100%;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="25" height="25"> <strong>Converting Units</strong></h2>
<p>Sometimes you must convert between units of measure when different units are given.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you want to determine the measure of a 4 foot table in inches. A foot is a larger unit of measure than an inch, because 1 foot = 12 inches. You can use a bar model to help you to determine how many inches are equal to 4 feet.</p>
<table border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 96.2312%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="width: 19.9739%;">1 foot</td>
<td style="width: 19.9739%;">1 foot</td>
<td style="width: 19.9739%;">1 foot</td>
<td style="width: 19.9739%;">1 foot</td>
<td style="width: 19.9739%;">= 4 feet</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="width: 19.9739%;">12 inches</td>
<td style="width: 19.9739%;">12 inches</td>
<td style="width: 19.9739%;">12 inches</td>
<td style="width: 19.9739%;">12 inches</td>
<td style="width: 19.9739%;">= 48 inches</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Each foot is equal to 12 inches, and so 4 feet would be equal to 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 <em>or</em> 4(12), which is equal to 48 inches.</p>
<p>If you need to convert from a larger unit to a smaller unit, you multiply the number of larger units by the number of smaller units in one larger unit. In our example, there are 4 feet (larger units) and so we multiply by 12 (the number of smaller units in 1 foot) to convert from feet to inches.</p>

<p><em>Who do you think invented the light bulb - Thomas Edison or Sir Humphrey Davy?</em></p>
<p>Most people credit Thomas Edison with inventing the light bulb. <em>Did you know that it was actually invented by a British scientist, Sir Humphrey Davy, in 1802?</em> Thomas Edison invented the first long-lasting light bulb in 1880. Edison’s light bulb was not the first, but it was his light bulb that worked well enough for people to use in their daily lives.</p>
