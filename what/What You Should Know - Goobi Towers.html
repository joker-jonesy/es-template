<p><em>Have you ever wondered how towers are designed?</em> Architects and engineers work together to design buildings that meet people’s needs and look good. When building a tower, architects and engineers must consider the types of building materials and the cost of materials and labor when building structures. Buildings require a great deal of material so it is important that architects and engineers choose materials that are strong and cheap.</p>
<p>Towers are used for many different purposes. Towers have been built to serve as strategic advantages for observing and guarding, provide electricity, enhance communication, help support bridges, and even direct plane, boat, and car traffic. Towers traditionally served one purpose, but tower design today includes residences, shops, and restaurants.</p>

<p>The tallest tower in the world is the Tokyo SkyTree in Tokyo, Japan. The Tokyo SkyTree is 2,080 feet tall, and is made of steel. It serves as a broadcast tower, observation deck for tourists, and even has a restaurant. It was built to withstand earthquakes and has a three leg, tripod design.</p>
<p>The Canton Tower in China, the second tallest tower in the world at 1,982 feet, is made out of steel and concrete. It serves as a telecommunications tower, and has an observation deck for tourists and a restaurant.</p>

<p>There are many people that help design and build towers. If you wanted to build a tower today, your building team would likely include an architect, building engineers, draftsperson, building designer, surveyors, electricians, plumbers, painters, elevator mechanic, carpenter, laborers, and many others.</p>

<p>There are many strategies used to <strong>divide</strong> numbers. Knowing that multiplication and division are related helps in remembering division facts. If you know that 7×4 = 28 then you know that 28÷7 = 4. The <strong>quotient</strong> is 4. The related fact is 28÷4 = 7. The quotient is 7.</p>
<p>Another strategy is to “pull out groups”. This strategy works nicely for problems such as, “Teun puts 32 pears into cartons. Each carton holds 8 pears. <em>How many cartons does he need?</em>”</p>
<p>This is written as 32÷8 = ? Eight are counted and moved into a group. Then another 8 are counted and moved into a group. The goal is to find out how many groups of 8 are in 32. The quotient for this problem is 4. Teun needs 4 cartons.</p>
<p><img src="../Liftoff%20Challenges/Mechanics%20and%20Structures/Goobi/Towers/Goobi_Division1_CLS.jpg" alt="make groups of 8" title="make groups of 8" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>Other times, the number of groups is given. “Sanji has 42 stickers. She wants to give the same number to each of her 6 cousins. <em>How many stickers will each cousin get?</em>” This is written the same way: 42÷6 = ? The strategy is to first make the groups, and then fill the groups until all of the cards are divided.</p>
<p><img src="../Liftoff%20Challenges/Mechanics%20and%20Structures/Goobi/Towers/Goobi_Division2_CLS.jpg" alt="make groups of 6" title="make groups of 6" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>The quotient is 7.</p>
<p>Not all division problems come out even; sometimes there is a leftover. Look at this problem. “Hernan wants to make a tower using rectangles. He has 35 red connectors. Each rectangle needs 4 connectors. <em>How many red rectangles can he make?</em>”</p>
<p>The problem is written as 35÷4=?</p>
<p><img src="../Liftoff%20Challenges/Mechanics%20and%20Structures/Goobi/Towers/Goobi_Division3_CLS.jpg" alt="35 divided into groups of 4" title="35 divided into groups of 4" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>He can make 8 rectangles. There are 3 connectors left over. Some people write their quotient as 35÷4=8&nbsp; <em>r</em>3. The little r stands for <strong>remainder</strong>. It does not matter what you call it; just be sure to remember that there were some connectors left over.</p>

<h3>Architect/Landscape Architect&nbsp;</h3>
<p>An architect is a person who designs buildings. Some architects focus on environmentally friendly buildings. There are even landscape architects that design parks. Others may focus on tall buildings or shopping malls.</p>
<p>All architects study math and use patterns and shapes when they make their designs. They also have to know how shapes fit together and which shapes are stronger so that buildings and towers can stay upright.</p>

<h3>Structural Engineer</h3>
<p>A structural engineer takes the architect’s design and figures out how to build it. They must know how to make sure the building won’t fall down. They have to know how strong the materials must be. The structural engineer works with the architect to make the original design better. They also work with the builder to make sure the right materials are used.</p>
<p>Both the architect and the structural engineer use division. They make a scale model to test their designs. A scale model uses the final size divided by a fixed number. For a building that will be 90 feet tall, the structural engineer might divide all of the measurements by 45 and create a 2 foot tall model.</p>
