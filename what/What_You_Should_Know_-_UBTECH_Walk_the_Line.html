<ul>
<li><strong>Block Programming -&nbsp;</strong>visual instruction blocks are used to create programs by dragging and dropping different blocks</li>
<li><strong>Inches -&nbsp;</strong>a unit of length, there are 12 inches in a foot</li>
<li><strong>Feet -&nbsp; </strong>a unit of length</li>
<li><strong>Length -&nbsp;</strong>how far it is from one thing to another</li>
<li><strong>Line Plot -&nbsp;</strong>a way to show data using a number line</li>
<li><strong>Yard -&nbsp;</strong>a unit of length, it is equal to 3 feet or 12 inches</li>

<p>When we measure how long something is or how far something moves, we are measuring length. We use different units of measurement to measure lengths depending on how small or how large the distance is, some common measurements include centimeters (cm), inches (in), feet (ft), meters (m), or yards (y).&nbsp;A ruler is a handheld measurement tool that commonly shows the markings for some of these units. The common ruler below shows inches on one side and centimeters on the other.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A ruler also measures fractions of length. The ruler here is marked with whole number measurements but also parts of whole numbers including ¼ inches and ½ inches.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A line plot is a way for you to show the data that you have collected in an easy to read way. A line plot runs along a number line and x’s or check marks show how many times something happens. In the example, below, you can see the number of students who have pencils. One student has 6 pencils and 4 students don’t have any pencils at all.</p>

<p>Coding is a way to give instructions to a computer. The code or program are instructions for a computer - it tells the computer exactly what to do. Code needs to be precise for a computer to successfully follow it. For example, your code can’t simply say move- the computer needs to know how to move, how long to move, and when to stop. The code instructions must also be written in the right order. <em>Does the robot need to go forward for three seconds and then turn? Or turn and then go forward for three seconds?</em></p>
<p>There are different ways to code a computer called programming languages. UBTECH's programming language uses code blocks to create a program. The code blocks tell the computer what to do. These blocks can be dragged and dropped into a workspace and they click together just like puzzle pieces to create list of things the computer will do.</p>
<p>Here is sample of what a program might look like in UKIT EDU app when it is finished:</p>
<p><img src="../LiftoffChallenges/Robotics%20and%20Control%20Technology/UBTECH/Walk%20the%20Line/UBTECH_SampleProgram1_CLS.png" alt="sample program" title="sample program" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%;"></p>
<p>In the UKIT EDU App there is a workspace. You will be using the left side of the screen in the workspace to choose different code blocks to control your robot. After you locate a code block, drag and drop it into the workspace. The code blocks are categorized into different types of commands. It sometimes takes a few tries to get the computer to tell the robot exactly what you want it to do - that’s okay! You can try it over and over again.</p>
<p>The picture below shows a student who is beginning to code their robot. They are choosing the commands from the left side of the screen in the UKIT EDU app.</p>

<h3>Scientists and Teachers</h3>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-8">
<p>Line plots can help to organize data for meteorologists or other scientists. They can use them to display data like the amount of rain that falls every day or the temperatures every day at a certain time. Line plots help make data more visual, this helps scientists more easily identify trends and other important information.&nbsp;</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Teachers also use line plots to graph useful data to help inform decisions. A line plot showing student test data could help a teacher to better understand the concepts that the students understand very well and quickly determine what concepts might need additional teaching.&nbsp;</p>
