<h2 id="mcetoc_1bg60dnfq2"><img src="../CLS_Template/HQTemplates/CLSIcons-Explore-Color.png" alt="" title="" style="max-width: 100%;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="25" height="25"> Metric System</h2>
<p>The Metric System is a system of measurement that is based in units of ten. It uses grams (mass), meters (length) and liter (volume) as its base units. The metric system is the most commonly used measurement system in the world and is sometimes also referred to as the International System of Units (SI). The metric system uses “pre-fixes”, or a word placed before another word, to go from smaller units of measurement to larger units of measurement. Milligrams, grams and kilograms are used to measure mass or weight.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/ClimateKids_MeasureTape_Pixabay.jpg" alt="measuring tape with feet and meters" title="measuring tape with feet and meters" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%;"></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1bg60dnfq2"><img src="../CLS_Template/HQTemplates/CLSIcons-Explore-Color.png" alt="" title="" style="max-width: 100%;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="25" height="25"> Metric System Conversions</h2>
<p>Since the metric system is based in units of ten, you can easily convert between the different metric measurements by multiplying or dividing by multiples of 10. The “pre-fixes” of the words let you know how many of that measurement are in your base unit. For example, with mass your base unit is grams. In “milligram” the pre-fix is “milli”. Milli means “one thousandth part of” which lets us know that there are 1000 milligrams in 1 gram. If you were converting from grams to milligrams then you would divide by 1000. If you were converting from milligrams to grams then you would multiply by 1000.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Example 1: Convert 3 grams (g) to milligrams (mg)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">1 <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 255);">g</span> = 1000 <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 26);">mg</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">3 <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 255);">g</span> × 1000 = 3000 <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 26);">mg</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Example 2: Convert 400 milligrams (mg) to grams (g)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">1 <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 255);">g</span> = 1000 <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 26);">mg</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">400 <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 26);">mg</span> ÷ 1000 = 0.4 <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 255);">g</span></p>
<p>Another example would be “kilogram”. The pre-fix “kilo” means “1000 of” which means there are 1000 grams in 1 kilogram. To convert from kilograms to grams, you would multiply by 1000. To convert from grams to kilograms, you would divide by 1000.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Example 1: Convert 0.4 kilograms (kg) to grams (g)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">1000 <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 255);">g</span> = 1 <span style="color: rgb(3, 150, 32);">kg</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">0.6 <span style="color: rgb(3, 150, 32);">kg</span> × 1000 = 600 <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 255);">g</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Example 2: Convert 20 grams (g) to kilograms (kg)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">1000 <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 255);">g</span> = 1 <span style="color: rgb(3, 150, 32);">kg</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">20 <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 255);">g</span> ÷ 1000 = 0.020 <span style="color: rgb(3, 150, 32);">kg</span></p>
<p>This rule is not only true for grams, but for the other base units as well: liters and meters. The following table can be used to help you convert.</p>

<p>PPM is an abbreivation that stands for parts-per-million and can also be represented as milligrams per liter. It is used to describe the concentration of different substances in air, water, or soil. When measuring the substances in air, it lets you know the number molecules of that substance per million molecules of dry air. For example, if you had a CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp; concentration of 100 ppm then you would have 100 molecules of CO<sub>2</sub> for every million molecules of dry air. Due to the fact that it can also be written as milligrams per liter then &nbsp;this could also be written as 100 mg/L CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1bg60dnfq2"><img src="../CLS_Template/HQTemplates/CLSIcons-Explore-Color.png" alt="" title="" style="max-width: 100%;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="25" height="25"> Line Graphs</h2>
<p>A line graph is a type of graph that uses data points and a line that connects them. This graph is typically used to track changes over time. You can decide how you would like to display time. If you are showing changes over a long period of time you may want to use decades, periods of ten years, and the average change. If you are showing changes over a shorter period then you may want to go in periods of 1 year, 2 years or 5 years. It just depends on the data set.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/ClimateKids_LineGraph_Pixabay.jpg" alt="line graph" title="line graph" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%;"></p>
<p>Line graphs have two axes: y-axis (vertical) and the x-axis (horizontal). Time data is usually on the x-axis because it is the independent axis (the data does not depend on other factors). The data that is being measured is typically put on the y-axis because it is the dependent axis (the data depends on other factors). Both of the axes should be labeled to make them easier to read and understand. Your line graph should also contain a descriptive title so that readers know what information they are looking at.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/ClimateKids_Axes_CLS.png" alt="graph with y-axis and x-axis labels" title="graph with y-axis and x-axis labels" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%;"></p>
<p>When making line graphs scientists usually make a data table first. The data table should include the information that you are going to put on your graph. This data table is then used to quickly and efficiently plot your information.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1bg60dnfq2"><img src="../CLS_Template/HQTemplates/CLSIcons-Explore-Color.png" alt="" title="" style="max-width: 100%;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="25" height="25"> Greenhouse Gasses</h2>
<p>Earth’s atmosphere contains gases, called greenhouse gases, that help keep earth warm by trapping the energy from the sun. This is called the greenhouse effect because like a greenhouse the light from the sun comes through and the heat gets trapped inside. These gases are very important because without them the heat would escape and earth would be too cold to support life. However, when the amount of these gases increases it leads to more heat being trapped and warmer temperatures. &nbsp;The amount of these gases has increased a lot over the past few hundred years due to certain human activities such as driving cars and heating and powering homes and buildings. The energy needed for these activities is created through the burning of fossil fuels. Oil, gas, and coal are fossil fuels. When these fuels are burned to create energy they release chemicals and greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub> ), into the air.</p>

<p>Global warming is how the earth has gotten hotter over the past few hundred years. Global warming can be dangerous because it can cause glaciers to melt and sea levels to rise. The effect that global warming has on weather is called climate change.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1bg60dnfq2"><img src="../CLS_Template/HQTemplates/CLSIcons-Explore-Color.png" alt="" title="" style="max-width: 100%;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="25" height="25"> Climate Change</h2>
<p>Climate change is the study of how the average weather in an area has changed over time. Climate change occurs naturally on Earth. Climate can change depending on how much energy the sun is giving off, changes in the ocean, natural disasters like volcanoes, asteroids hitting Earth, etc. However, over the past few decades our world’s climate has changed much faster due to global warming. When the climate changes too quickly it can be dangerous because it does not allow time for living organisms and ecosystems on Earth to adapt. Climate not only has changed with hotter temperatures but also in unexpected ways too such as intense and major storms. To slow down global warming, we need to stop burning so much fossil fuel. Instead of using fossil fuels, we can make electricity from renewable resources such as sunlight and wind. Making electricity from sunlight or wind does NOT cause air pollution.</p>
