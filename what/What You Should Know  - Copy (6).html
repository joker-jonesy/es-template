<h1>What you Should Know</h1>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1ckaqav00h">Types of Bulbs</h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">There are a few different types of light bulbs that you may see in your house and in your school.&nbsp;<strong>Compact fluorescent</strong>&nbsp;(CFL) and l<strong>ight emitting diode</strong>&nbsp;(LED) bulbs fit most light sockets and are the most energy efficient.&nbsp;<strong>Fluorescent</strong>&nbsp;bulbs are shaped like tubes and are filled with mercury gas that shines when electricity is added. They use less energy than the incandescent bulbs.&nbsp;<strong>Incandescent</strong>&nbsp;bulbs are also called&nbsp;<strong>standard</strong>&nbsp;bulbs. They are still common in our homes and use a filament that glows inside to generate light. They do not last as long as CFL and LED bulbs, and they are the least energy efficient.&nbsp;<strong>Halogen</strong>&nbsp;bulbs are similar to incandescent bulbs because they have a filament inside which heats and glows, but they also have halogen gas, which makes them last longer and use less energy than an incandescent bulb.</span></p>
<p><img src="../Liftoff%20Challenges/Sustainability/Energy%20Efficiency/Too%20Bright/bulb-chart_energyefficiency.png" alt="lightbulb efficiency chart" title="lightbulb efficiency chart" style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="528" height="490" /></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">In 2007, the United States Congress passed the Energy Independence and Security Act which set new standards for the energy efficiency of light bulbs. Incandescent bulbs are being phased out for longer-lasting and lower-energy-consuming light bulbs like compact fluorescent and light emitting diode light bulbs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1ckaqbuies">What are Watts, Volts, and Lumens?</h2>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1ckaqbuies"><img src="../Liftoff%20Challenges/Sustainability/Energy%20Efficiency/Too%20Bright/100w-bulb_energyefficiency.jpg" alt="100 watt bulb " title="100 watt bulb " style="max-width: 100%; float: right;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="183" height="243" /></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">When we are talking about light bulbs, there are a few different words people use to describe them.&nbsp;<strong>Watts&nbsp;</strong>is the wattage or&nbsp;the amount of power (energy during a certain amount of time) that a light bulb uses.&nbsp;<strong>Volts</strong>&nbsp;is the voltage or the amount of electrical pressure that goes into the bulb from the electrical outlet. It is important for safety and efficiency&nbsp;that your light bulb matches the voltage requirements for the light fixture.&nbsp;<strong>Lumens</strong>&nbsp;is&nbsp;the brightness or the amount of light you see from the bulb when it is lit. The most efficient bulbs generate more lumens using fewer watts.</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1ckaqav00i">Picking the Best Bulbs</h2>
<p><img src="../Liftoff%20Challenges/Sustainability/Energy%20Efficiency/Too%20Bright/lumen-chart_energyefficiency.png" alt="lumen diagram" title="lumen diagram" style="max-width: 100%; float: right;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="272" height="248" /><span style="color: #333333;">Most people buy light bulbs that have a specific wattage and voltage instead of considering what strength of light they want in their&nbsp;space. Most spaces are overly lit, wasting energy that is not needed for the stuff that happens in that room. Think about how bright you need a space to be when you think about light bulbs.&nbsp;<em>How many lumens do you need in your space?</em>&nbsp;The table&nbsp; shows the recommended lumen rating for different spaces in your home.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><em>What spaces have the highest lumens? Why do you think that they have high lumens? What space has the lowest lumens? Why do you think that they have the lowest lumens?</em></span></p>
