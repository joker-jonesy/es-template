<ul>
<li><b>Hypothesis </b>- an educated guess, or a guess you make based on information you already know.</li>
<li><b>Motion </b>- the action or process of moving or being moved.</li>
<li><b>Evaluating </b>- to determine the significance, worth, or condition of, usually by careful appraisal and study.</li>
<li><b>Inertia</b> - do nothing or to remain unchanged.</li>
<li><b>Mass</b> - the amount of matter or substance that makes up an object.</li>
<li><b>Weight</b> - the force with which an object near the Earth is attracted toward the center of the body by gravity.</li>
<li><b>Momentum</b> - describes the strength of a moving object.</li>
<li><b>Friction</b> - force that resists the sliding or rolling of one solid object over another.</li>
<li><b>Velocity </b>- measure of how fast something moves in a particular direction.</li>
<li><b>Position </b>- the way in which something or someone is placed or arranged.</li>
<li><b>Acceleration </b>- measurement of change in an object's speed and direction.</li>
</ul>

<p>Everything that happens in the solar system, even here on Earth has an effect on every other thing. Physics is the study of those effects. Physics is a science that relates to all other sciences: chemistry, biology, geology, astronomy, meteorology, engineering, etc. If you can name it, chances are physics is involved.</p>
<p>The physics of motion<b> </b>is all about force. A force<b> </b>is needed to make an object move, or to change its motion. Changes in motion don't just happen on their own. How fast an object moves is called its speed or velocity, and it can be influenced by forces.</p>
<p>Acceleration<b> </b>is a twist on the idea of velocity. Acceleration is a measure of how much the velocity of an object changes in a certain time. Velocity can either increase or decrease over time. Mass is another big idea in motion. Mass is the amount of something there is. This is not to get confused with weight. Mass<b> </b>is how much area that object takes up, while weight is how much force that object is pushing against gravity.</p>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-12">
<p>Forces affect how objects move. They may cause the motion; they may also slow, stop, or change the direction of motion of an object that is already moving. An object with more weight is more massive, and an object that is massive has more inertia. Inertia is what causes an object to resist change in speed.</p>

<figcaption><span style="font-size: 1.1875rem; color: #494c4e;">For example, there are two wheelbarrows in front of me. One has 5 bags of soil, and the other is empty. The wheelbarrow with the five bags of soil will have more resistance, or inertia, to move because it weighs more.</span></figcaption>

<p>If you look at the image, the ball is not moving. If the player was to continue, his kick would make the ball move. How hard he kicks (how much force he applies) determines how fast the ball would move. <i>What happens to the ball's velocity, or speed, right after it is kicked?</i></p>

<p>A hypothesis is a guess as to why or how something has or will happen. A hypothesis can be tested to figure out if it’s correct. We use our background knowledge and what we know about the world to make this guess. While many believe that we only use hypotheses only in science, we actually use them in our daily lives. For example, you or a parent may be cooking and think, “What ingredient should I add to make this taste better? Hmm, maybe garlic powder!” You are forming a hypothesis before testing it out, likely based on food you’ve made or had in the past.</p>
<p>When scientists develop a hypothesis, they normally follow these steps:</p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Make observations.</li>
<li>Define the problem or question.</li>
<li>Research the problem.</li>
<li>Use the research and observations to form a hypothesis, which is the solution or answer to the problem or question.</li>
</ol>

<p>When you make a hypothesis, ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>What is your question or problem?</i></li>
<li><i>Have you observed a situation like this before? What did you notice?</i></li>
<li><i>How could you learn more before making your hypothesis? What would you need to know?</i></li>
<li><i>What is your answer or solution?</i> Remember: It should make sense with what you’ve observed or researched!</li>
</ul>

<p>The title offers a short explanation of what is in your graph. This helps the reader identify what they are about to look at. It can be creative or simple as long as it tells what is in the graph. The title of the graph below is Hospital Admittees.</p>

<h3>Roller Coaster Engineer</h3>
<p><em>Have you ever been on a roller coaster?</em> <em>A wooden roller coaster that whips you around, a steel roller coaster that twists and turns you upside down? </em>Engineers who design roller coasters use a lot of physics in order to make a ride that is not only fun, but safe. They have to think about how much all of the materials weigh, plus the weight of all of the people who can ride at once, then the speed to allow it to make it over the drops.</p>

<h3 id="mcetoc_1bg60dnfq2">Semi-Truck Driver</h3>
<p>Truck drivers carry heavy loads all over the county. They are needed to transport goods from farms and distribution centers to the rest of the nation. After they get their load, they get sent to a certain location. Due to their size and the weight of their load, they have to adjust their speed, find different roads, and even find different ways to turn and move around objects.</p>
