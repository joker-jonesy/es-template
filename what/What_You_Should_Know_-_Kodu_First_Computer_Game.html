<p>When you make a computer game, you are actually writing a computer program. Your program tells the computer how your game is played using instructions called <strong>code</strong>. In some computer languages, you write code by typing. In Kodu, writing code is as easy as clicking your mouse.</p>

<p>Each line in this picture is a line of code. Each line acts as a rule or command that tells your computer how your game is played. A rule is a line of When &amp; Do commands.&nbsp; (When ____ happens, the object should do ____.)</p>

<p><strong>Aerial views</strong> are pictures taken from above an object or location. It allows the viewer to see something from the top of it. For example, take a look at the photograph. It shows buildings with a view from above them. This photograph was probably taken from a drone or airplane.</p>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1bg60dnfq2"><img src="../CLS_Template/HQ%20Templates/CLS%20Icons%20-%20Explore%20-%20Color.png" alt="" title="" style="max-width: 100%;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="25" height="25"> <strong>Finding Area with Tiling and Multiplication</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Area</strong> is the total space that fills in a shape. You can find the area of a shape using different methods. One way to find the area of a shape is to use multiplication.</p>
<p>To find the area of a shape, we can multiply the length by the width of a rectangle or square.</p>
<p>A = L x W</p>
<p>If the length of a rectangle is 4ft and the width is 3ft, we can multiply these dimensions to find the area.</p>
<p>A = L x W</p>
<p>A = 4 x 3</p>
<p>A = 12 ft</p>
<p>Another way to find the area of a shape is by tiling. To tile a shape, you need to first look at the given dimensions. The length of this rectangle is 6 inches. The width of the rectangle is 2 inches.</p>
<p><img src="../Express%20Challenges/Software%20Engineering/Kodu/First%20Computer%20Game/Kodu_2x6Rectangle_CLS.PNG" alt="area of rectangle" title="area of rectangle" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%;"></p>
<p>To use the tiling method to find the area, we need to divide the rectangle into unit squares.</p>
<p>A unit square is simply a square with sides that are one unit long.</p>
<table border="4" height="15" style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 4.17829%; height: 28px; border-color: black; border-style: solid;">
<tbody>
<tr style="height: 28px;">
<td style="width: 100%; height: 28px;"></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>1 unit square</p>
<p>To tile a shape, you need to draw lines inside the shape. In this case, we are tiling a rectangle. Since the rectangle is 6 inches long, we will first draw 6 vertical lines. These lines need to be equally spaced.</p>
<p>Next, you will need to divide the shape in half. This is because the shape is 2 inches wide. You will draw one horizontal line through the shape.</p>
<p>To find the area, you will count the number of tiles in the shape. There are 12 tiles in this rectangle. The area of this shape is 12 square inches.</p>
<p><img src="../Express%20Challenges/Software%20Engineering/Kodu/First%20Computer%20Game/Kodu_2x6Grid_CLS.PNG" alt="the area of this shape is 12 square inches " title="the area of this shape is 12 square inches " data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%;"></p>
<p>Another way to find the area of a shape is to use multiplication. To use multiplication to find the area, you will multiply the length of the shape by its width. For the rectangle above, you would multiply 6 inches by 2 inches. This would give you 12 square inches.</p>
<p>Let’s find the area of the square. The length and width of the polygon are 4.</p>
<p><img src="../Express%20Challenges/Software%20Engineering/Kodu/First%20Computer%20Game/Kodu_4x4Square_CLS.PNG" alt="length and width of polygon is 4" title="length and width of polygon is 4" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%;"></p>
<p>To use the tiling method to find the area, divide the shape into 4 parts vertically and horizontally. To do this, you need to draw 3 equal-spaced lines going up and down and then across.</p>
<p>Now, count the total number of unit squares in the shape. There are 16 unit squares total. This shape is 16 units².</p>
<p><img src="../Express%20Challenges/Software%20Engineering/Kodu/First%20Computer%20Game/Kodu_4x4SquareGrid_CLS.PNG" alt="16 units²" title="16 units²" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%;"></p>

<h3>Architect</h3>
<p>Architects design buildings, they need to figure out the area of buildings and rooms within them so they can design buildings and structures that we can use. If they design a stadium, they need to figure out how much area they need for a field and how much area they need for seats.</p>

<h3>Carpenter</h3>
<p>Carpenters work to build the plans of architects. If architects design a home to be a certain size, carpenters will use math to figure out the different amounts of materials used for the floors, walls, and ceiling like carpet, paint, curtains, or even specific appliances, like stoves and toilets.</p>
