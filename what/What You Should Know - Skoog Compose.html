<ul>
<li><strong>Beat </strong>- the basic unit of time in music</li>
<li><strong>Fraction </strong>-&nbsp; part of a whole</li>
<li><strong>Note </strong>- a symbol to show a sound in music</li>
<li><strong>Octave </strong>- the distance between a note (like C) and the next note of the same name</li>
<li><strong>Numerator </strong>- the top number in a fraction; in the fraction ¼, 1 is the numerator</li>
<li><strong>Denominator </strong>- the bottom number in a fraction; in the fraction ¼, 4 is the denominator</li>
</ul>

<p>When you <strong>compose</strong> music, you write music. There are lots of ways to write down your music so that you remember it. With Skoog you can write down the pattern of colors. A more popular way to write music is using music notation or music language. Music notation lets people all over the world read your music and play it. Music notation can look complicated at first, but it is just like any other language, if you practice, it will become easy to read and write.</p>

<p>Musicians understand that math is related to music. They have to count beats and rhythms each time they play even the simplest of melodies.</p>
<p>Reading music is almost like reading math symbols; the notes, rests, and other symbols represent information about the song. Music is divided into sections known as measures. Each measure is then divided into beats.</p>
<p>The image below shows a <strong>scale</strong>. The fancy symbol on the left is called a treble clef. This means these <strong>notes</strong> have a higher pitch than notes found in musical compositions using other clefs (alto, tenor, or bass). The first note is “C.” Each note goes up in pitch in the C Major scale.</p>
<figure><span style="font-size: 19px;"><img src="../LiftoffChallenges/Digital%20Communications/Skoog/Compose/music-notation_skoog.png" alt="music notation" title="music notation" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></span>
<figcaption></figcaption>
<span style="font-size: 19px;"><em>Do you see the line separating the first four notes from the last four notes?</em> This shows a measure. The first measure has four quarter notes; so does the second measure. Each note is one <strong>beat</strong>. There are four beats in each measure, for a total of eight beats in this line.</span></figure>
<p>There are numbers beside the treble clef: 4 over 4. The <strong>numerator</strong> means there are four beats in each measure. The <strong>denominator</strong> tells you that each quarter note is one beat. What is 4/4? One whole! <em>What is ¼ + ¼ + ¼ + ¼?</em> One whole!</p>
<p>As you can see, musical notes are <strong>fractions</strong>. A measure is a small section of the song; in this case, 4 beats of the song. Beats are the fractions in the measures, and we know how many there are in a single measure by looking at the numerator of the fraction written next to the clef symbol.</p>
<p>Look at this measure:</p>
<p><img src="../LiftoffChallenges/Digital%20Communications/Skoog/Compose/Skoog_MusicNotes_Pixabay%20(1).gif" alt="music notes" title="music notes" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>These notes are also in treble clef. There is no time measure, like the C Major scale. Each note with a single stem is one beat. Each note with two stems connected by double lines at the top is a double beat. Each double beat makes up one whole beat. So, each note of the double beat is ½ of a whole beat: ½ +&nbsp;½ = 1.</p>
<p>If you were to add up the total beats in this measure, you would add: 1 + 1 + ½ +&nbsp;½ + 1. The total number of beats in this measure equals 4. A lot of music has four beats per measure.</p>
<p><strong>Fun Fact!</strong> Each whole beat is actually a quarter note. This is because each beat is counted as one of the four total beats in the measure. (Think… A quarter is ¼ of a dollar. A quarter note is ¼. So, to add the beats for this measure, add ¼ + ¼ + ⅛ +&nbsp;⅛ + ¼ = 1.</p>

<p>Composers are people that compose or write music of all types, including vocal music, instrumental music, and electronic music. A composer may create music in any music genre, including, classical music, musical theatre, blues, folk music, jazz, and popular music. Some musicians compose their own music to perform while other musicians perform music from other composers.</p>

<p>A regular major scale has 7 notes. The beginning and end are different <strong>octaves</strong> of the same note C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C (An octave is the distance between two musical notes that have the same letter name.), and is called a heptatonic scale. A major scale example is the famous Do-Ra-Me-Fa-So-La-Ti-Do.</p>
<p><img src="../LiftoffChallenges/Digital%20Communications/Skoog/Compose/do-re-mi_skoog.png" alt="major scale example: Do-Ra-Me-Fa-So-La-Ti-Do." title="major scale example: Do-Ra-Me-Fa-So-La-Ti-Do." data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="464" height="289" style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>A pentatonic scale is a musical scale with only 5 notes per octave. When you play your Skoog, it uses five different sounds on each of its five sides and, therefore, it can be used to easily compose and play music on a pentatonic scale.&nbsp; Pentatonic scales are known for being nice to listen to no matter how you organize the individual notes. Because of this, pentatonic scales can be found in lots of different types of music including jazz, rock, and folk music across the world. “Old MacDonald,” “Auld Lang Syne” (the New Year's Eve song), and “Ring Around the Rosie” are all songs that use only the 5 notes in a pentatonic scale.</p>

<h3>Music in the World</h3>
<p>People like to put music to stories, animations, or other media that inform or tell a story. This helps make the story or information more interesting. The person adding the music can influence the emotions people feel when reading or watching. For example, a fairy tale might begin with happy-sounding music. When a villain comes along, the music may change and sound scary. The reader or watcher knows that something bad is going to happen!</p>
<h3>Audio Technician</h3>
<p>An audio technician is one career in music production. This person makes sure the quality of the sound is top-notch. Audio technicians work with fancy recording equipment and machines. They put the sounds together to get the desired effect. Another career is a sound designer. This person finds and creates live or recorded sounds that can be used in different situations. <em>Have you ever heard thunder or the sound of traffic in the background of a movie or show?</em> A sound designer was involved in finding the perfect sounds.</p>
