<ul>
<li><strong>Attributes </strong>- the properties a shape shares with similar shapes, such as the number of sides and angles, and the number of parallel sides</li>
<li><strong>Congruent </strong>- shapes or angles that have the same attributes and same size</li>
<li><strong>Force </strong>- a push or pull on an object that can change the object’s motion or direction</li>
<li><strong>Polygon </strong>- a closed figure made of straight lines connected at angles</li>
<li><strong>Quadrilateral </strong>- any four-sided polygon</li>
<li><strong>Similar Shapes </strong>- shapes with the same attributes or properties&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Work </strong>- Work is done when a force moves an object or load</li>
</ul>

<p>Shapes or angles that have the same <strong>attributes</strong> and same size are called <strong>congruent</strong>. It does not matter if the shape has been turned or is a mirror image. So, the shapes are congruent as long as the size—side lengths and angles measurements—are the same.</p>
<p><img src="../LiftoffChallenges/Mechanics%20and%20Structures/KNEX%20STEM%20Simple%20Machines/Gears/KNEXGears_ConguentTriangles.png" alt="congruent triangles" title="congruent triangles" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>These triangles are congruent.</p>
<p><strong>Similar</strong> shapes can have larger or smaller side lengths but must have the same angle measurements. It does not matter if the shape is turned or a mirror image; as long as the angle measures have not changed, the shapes are similar. These quadrilaterals are similar.</p>

<p>A triangle is a shape. Shapes can be grouped or classified in different ways based on different characteristics or attributes. An attribute that all triangles share is that they all have three sides. An attribute that all quadrilaterals share is that they all have four sides. Shapes that have the same attributes are called congruent.</p>
<p>Changing the length of the sides does not change its attributes. Rotating or turning a shape does not change its attributes.</p>
<p>Look at these rectangles. Describe how they are the same and how they are different.</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Are any of these <strong>congruent</strong>? If so, which ones?</em></li>
<li><em>Are any <strong>similar</strong>? If so, which ones?</em></li>
</ol>

<p>The job of a&nbsp;<strong>machine</strong>&nbsp;is to make&nbsp;<strong>work</strong>&nbsp;easier. It does this by changing how&nbsp;<strong>force</strong>&nbsp;is used to move an object, or load.</p>
<p>For example, you do work when you push a grocery cart at the store.</p>
<p>Pushing is the&nbsp;<strong>force</strong>&nbsp;you apply to your cart (your machine) to easily move groceries (your load). You also do work when you pull something in a wagon. A force can be a push or a pull.</p>
<p>A machine needs a source of energy in order to do work.</p>
<p>With some machines, you are the source of energy, like the man and boy in the example.</p>
<p>An energy source supplies energy to the machine so that it can do the work.</p>
<p></p>

<p>You may be that energy source with some machines, like the man and boy in the picture. Some machines have engines that provide energy.</p>

<p><img src="../LiftoffChallenges/Mechanics%20and%20Structures/KNEX%20STEM%20Simple%20Machines/Gears/gears_knexstem.jpg" alt="gears" title="gears" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="248" height="186" style="max-width: 100%; float: right;"><strong>Gears</strong> are wheels with teeth that turn together. When one gear is turned, the other gear turns too. If the gears are different sizes, they can be used to increase the energy of a turning force. The smaller wheel turns more quickly with less force, but the big wheel turns more slowly. Gears are also sometimes called toothed wheels, cogged wheels, or cogs. The cut teeth are also sometimes called cogs.</p>
<p>Cars and bicycles use gears to help them go fast; clocks use gears to keep the hands spinning.</p>
<p>There are different gears, but you will be building with the spur, crown, and sprocket gears.</p>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-8">
<p>Spur Gears: Spur gears are the simplest type of gear. They consist of a circle or disk with teeth sticking out. The teeth on the gears go together to make the gears move. Like the picture, spur gears are parallel when they fit together, which means they are side by side. Spur gears are excellent at medium speeds but can be noisy at high speeds. You will probably see spur gears in a car window or fan.</p>

You will probably see crown gears in blenders, turn-tables, and egg-beaters. You can tell a crown gear apart from a spur gear because crown gears fit together with other gears at an angle, like the corner of a table.</p>
<p><img src="../LiftoffChallenges/Mechanics%20and%20Structures/KNEX%20STEM%20Simple%20Machines/Gears/sprocket_knexstem.jpg" alt="sprocket gears" title="sprocket gears" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="388" height="258" style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>Sprocket Gears: Sprocket gears are usually used with a chain and do not fit with other gears. You can find sprocket gears on bicycles and motorcycles.</p>

<h3><strong>Bicycle Maintenance</strong></h3>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-8">
<p>Riding a bicycle used to be just for kids. Now, many cities have created lanes for adults who bicycle to work. This is to help reduce pollution from cars and buses. Other adults ride bicycles in competitions, including the Olympics. Some bicycle races can last several days.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-4">
<figure><img src="../LiftoffChallenges/Mechanics%20and%20Structures/KNEX%20STEM%20Simple%20Machines/Gears/KNEXGears_Bicycle_Pexels.jpeg" alt="bicycle gears" title="bicycle gears" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%;"></figure>
</div>
</div>
<p>There are many different bicycles, each used for a different reason. Some bikes now have very thick tires, while others have thin tires. A bike may have one speed, 5, 7, 12, 15, 18, or even 30. The number of gears on a bicycle determines the number of different speeds.</p>
<p>With the new technology in bicycles, the career of bicycle maintenance has become very important. Anyone doing routine or emergency maintenance must understand both how gears work together as well as how the attributes of the other parts create a support system. The spokes form a series of triangles that support the wheel to stay in the shape of a circle. Triangles and quadrilaterals are used in the frame.</p>
<p>Shifting gears must be smooth. When the gears or chains do not connect correctly, the bike can crash and become ruined. Bicycles used for racing and commuting to work can be very expensive, so their owners want a highly skilled person to do the maintenance.</p>
<h3><strong>Orthopedic Surgeon</strong></h3>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-8">
<p>Doctors can specialize in many different areas. One specialty is orthopedics. An orthopedic specialist is one who focuses on bones and joints. Most of the time, they can repair bones broken in an accident. Many injuries are from playing sports, riding a bicycle, or car accidents. When a bone or joint cannot be repaired, it can be replaced.</p>

<h3><strong>Bio-Engineer</strong></h3>
<p>The people who make limb replacements are called biomedical engineers.</p>
<p><img src="../LiftoffChallenges/Mechanics%20and%20Structures/KNEX%20STEM%20Simple%20Machines/Gears/KNEXGears_ArtificialLeg_Pexels.jpeg" alt="artificial leg" title="artificial leg" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%;"></p>
<p>This branch of engineering uses both mechanical and electrical parts to make the new joint or limb. Artificial limbs let the patient be independent and do most things other people can do. A special type of artificial leg uses gears in the joint to make movements such as running and jumping more natural.&nbsp; Once the artificial limb is made, it may get covered with material to make it look natural.</p>
