<h1>What You Should Know</h1>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1bg90uu790">How to Use K'NEX</h2>
<p>K'NEX&nbsp;kits are mostly made up of parts called&nbsp;<strong><em>connectors</em></strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong><em>rods</em></strong>. There are many shapes and sizes. Every rod can fit into connectors three different ways.&nbsp;Try them out!&nbsp;<em>Can you figure out all three ways?</em></p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong>&nbsp;Be sure to push parts together and pull them apart without bending them. This will help you avoid breaking any pieces.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1bg908ctg4">What Is Conservation of Angular Momentum?</h2>
<p><em>What keeps your bicycle from falling over?</em>&nbsp;It is the same thing that keeps a spinning top upright.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Physics tells us that an object in motion tends to stay in motion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The same idea applies to spinning objects, like a top. When a top is spinning in a circle, it wants to keep turning in the same circle until some other force changes its spinning motion. In fact, the faster the object spins, the harder it is for any "wobbling" forces to tip it over. Scientists call this&nbsp;<strong><em>conservation of angular momentum</em></strong>.</p>
<p>This law of physics is also what helps keep your bicycle from falling over. You may have even noticed that the faster your wheels spin, the easier it is to stay upright. The faster an object moves, the more difficult it is to change its motion.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1bg908ctg5">Why Does Friction Matter?</h2>
<p>No matter what, at least one outside force will act against the spinning top&rsquo;s motion.</p>
<p><em><strong>Friction</strong></em>&nbsp;is the resisting force created by one surface rubbing against another. Since a top spins on a tiny point, there is not a lot of&nbsp;<em>friction</em>&nbsp;with the surface it is spinning on. This means a good top will spin for a long time. Nevertheless, there is always some friction, so the top will eventually be slowed down to the point where gravity will be able to tip it over.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the tip of the spinning top rubs against the table, friction acts against it. There is even a little bit of friction from the outside of the top rubbing against the air. This is called&nbsp;<em><strong>drag</strong></em>.</p>
<p>As the top is slowed down by these forces, it becomes easier for the force of gravity to make it wobble and fall over.</p>
