<ul>
<li><strong>Sound Story </strong>- a story (usually a book) that uses sound to enhance the experience for the reader</li>
<li><strong>Sound Effects </strong>- sounds that are added to movies, films or other media to enhance the experience for the reader</li>
<li><strong>Onomatopoeia </strong>- words that name a sound while also sounding like the sound. Examples: pop, squeak, bang, boom</li>
<li><strong>Notes, Scales, and Keys </strong>- notes are different sounds in music that are grouped together to make scales while keys are specific scales like C sharp or E major</li>
</ul>

<p>You will be using GarageBand to create and find the sound effects that you will be using for your sound story. To do this you will need to record them as if they are a new instrument so that you can play them on the Skoog machine. You can use pre-recorded sound effects that are already in GarageBand or you can record your own sound effects.</p>
<h3>Record Original Sounds</h3>
<p>Use the following steps to record original sound effects:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open GarageBand on your iPad</li>
<li>Go to the instruments page. If you are on the songs or Recents page just click the plus sign in the top right.<br>
<p><img src="../Liftoff%20Challenges/Digital%20Communications/Skoog/Create%20a%20Sound%20Story/Skoog_Recents_CLS.png" alt="plus sign on recents page circled" title="plus sign on recents page circled" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%;"></p>
</li>
<li>Scroll left or right until you find Keyboard.</li>
<li>Click Sampler. This button allows you to sample or record new music.<br>

<li>To save the sound click the page icon in the top left corner.<br><img src="../Liftoff%20Challenges/Digital%20Communications/Skoog/Create%20a%20Sound%20Story/Skoog_PageIcon_CLS.png" alt="arrow pointing at page icon" title="arrow pointing at page icon" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%;"></li>
<li>When you save it will take you back to the Recents page. To rename your sound just hold down on it until the options pop up and click Rename.</li>
<li>You can access these sounds later by going to the Recents page.</li>
</ol>
<p>TIP: Name your sound so that you can easily find it later.</p>

<h3>Connecting Garage Band to Skoog&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Before you can play your sound effects, you need to connect GarageBand to Skoog. When you have them connected, you can play your Skoog while on the GarageBand app and you can also play the instruments and sounds from GarageBand while on the Skoog app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To connect GarageBand and Skoog do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the Skoog app, click on the MIDI icon.<br>
<p><img src="../Liftoff%20Challenges/Digital%20Communications/Skoog/Create%20a%20Sound%20Story/Skoog_MidiIcon_CLS.png" alt="arrow pointing to MIDI icon" title="arrow pointing to MIDI icon" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%;"></p>
</li>
<li>Slide button to turn MIDI on.<br>

</li>
<li>Go to the Garage Band App</li>
<li>Go to an instrument and click the settings gear icon in the top right corner.<br>
<p><img src="../Liftoff%20Challenges/Digital%20Communications/Skoog/Create%20a%20Sound%20Story/Skoog_SettingsGearIcon_CLS.png" alt="arrow pointing to settings gear icon" title="arrow pointing to settings gear icon" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%;"></p>
</li>
<li>Click on Advanced.<br>

</li>
<li>Turn on “Run in Background”. This allows you to play Garage Band instruments and sounds while on other applications.<br>

</li>
<li>Test it by selecting an instrument or sound and seeing if you hear it when you press the buttons on your Skoog.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1bg60dnfq2"><img src="/content/enforced/7112-cls_internal_course/CLS_Template/HQ%20Templates/CLS%20Icons%20-%20Explore%20-%20Color.png" alt="" title="" style="max-width: 100%;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="25" height="25"> Sound Effect</h2>
<p>A sound effect is a sound that is either created or enhanced artificially by a sound designer. A great example of this is when you are watching a funny show on television and you hear people laughing. While there may be a studio audience laughing, sound designers also usually add extra fake or artificial laughter to enhance the laughing heard by the audience. Sound designers add extra artificial laughs to help create a funny or comedic atmosphere which makes the viewers want to laugh. Sound effects are also added to videos we watch to enhance the plot or action. For example, if something shocking happens, an editor may add a “gasp” sound effect.</p>
<p>Sound designers sometimes have to get creative with how they make a fake or artificial sound. For example, a sound designer might want to add the sound of crunching snow to a story, maybe they don’t have any snow, or it’s the middle of summer. To solve this issue, sound designers try to create a similar sound from something else. They may take flour and put it into a cloth. When they push a shoe on or walk into the cloth where the flour is, to create an artificial sound of crunching snow!</p>
<p>When you are recording your sound effects you may have to get creative as well. Don’t be afraid to experiment!</p>

<p>Sound is an effective technique for telling stories. Sound effects are used to enhance stories and make them more entertaining. Some authors choose to write children’s books that use sound buttons to play as they are read. These are called sound books. As the reader is reading the book, they have buttons they can choose from to play. If the book is about animal sounds, the buttons may be different sounds that animals make and the reader can play the correct sound when they get to that animal. If they are on the cow’s page then they would play the “moo” sound, on the cat page they would play “meow”, and so on. Sound books are not just limited to animals. They can be used to enhance other readings as well. Imagine you are reading a story about a princess and a witch. When you read about the princess you may press a button to play a light twinkle sound and when you read about the witch you may play a scary lightening sound. It just depends on the book. <em>What types of books do you think would make the best sound books?</em></p>

<h3>Author</h3>
<p>Authors write books, short stories, essays, poems, and other types of texts. They can either write nonfiction which is based off real events, people, and facts, or fiction which is imagined or made up. Authors write for many different purposes like to inform, persuade, entertain, or to express feelings. Some authors like to pick a particular subject and audience to write for while others just enjoy writing about all things for all people.</p>

<h3>Sound Designer</h3>
<p>Sound designers work in theatre, video games, movies, and music. Their main responsibility is gathering and ensuring that they have all of the sounds needed for the production. This can include editing and enhancing sounds, creating and recording new sounds, and collecting sounds. Sound Designers are also in charge of the sound equipment and ensuring that it is working and set up correctly.</p>
<p><img src="../Liftoff%20Challenges/Digital%20Communications/Skoog/Create%20a%20Sound%20Story/Skoog_SoundDesigner_Pixabay.jpg" alt="picture of sound designer’s equipment" title="picture of sound designer’s equipment" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%;"></p>
<h3>Foley Artist</h3>
<p>Foley artists are a special type of sound designer. They work to create sounds during post production. They must ensure that the sound the make fits perfectly into the scene. For example, there may be a moment in a video game where the character shoots an arrow into a tree that is covered in snow. The foley artist is responsible for creating the sound of the arrow flying through the air, the arrow hitting the tree, and the snow falling to the ground. This is different from a normal sound effect that may just be an arrowing flying through the air. Foley artists use everyday objects to create these sound effects and watch the scene closely as they are recording to verify they are not missing any key details.</p>
