<ul>
<li><strong>Arithmetic Pattern </strong>- a list of numbers that follows a sequence</li>
<li><strong>Average </strong>- a number that describes what usually happens, or happens most often</li>
<li><strong>Data </strong>- facts, information, and evidence that is collected and can be examined or used to describe or explain events</li>
<li><strong>Scaled Graph </strong>- a bar or picture graph that uses one bar or symbol to represent more than one thing (for example, on a climate graph, one bar can represent a 10-year period, or a snowflake can represent 2 inches of snowfall)</li>
<li><strong>Global Climate Change </strong>- means that the average climate in the entire world is changing</li>
<li><strong>Climate</strong> - the general temperatures and weather conditions for a large area over a long period of time</li>
<li><strong>Weather </strong>- conditions including temperature, wind, rain or snow, cloud cover, and sunshine for a certain place and time</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="card-title"><strong>Commutative Property</strong></h2>
</div>
<div class="collapse">
<div class="card-body">
<p>When adding, the sum is the same even when the order is changed. For example, five plus seven is the same as seven plus five:</p>
<p>5 + 7 = 7 + 5</p>
<p>This is called the <strong>commutative property</strong>. In addition, the order can change without changing the answer.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="card">
<div class="card-header">
<h2 class="card-title"><strong>Substitution</strong></h2>
</div>
<div class="collapse">
<div class="card-body">
<p>Each number also can be broken down as a sum of two numbers.</p>
<p>Five is the same as two plus three: 5 = 2 + 3</p>
<p>Seven is the same as three plus four: 7 = 3 + 4</p>
<p>This is called <strong>substitution</strong>. Using substitution, the number sentence can be written several ways.</p>
<p>5 + 7 = 2 + 3 + 3 + 4</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="card">
<div class="card-header">
<h2 class="card-title"><strong>Associative Property</strong></h2>
</div>
<div class="collapse">
<div class="card-body">
<p>The <strong>associative property</strong> is a math rule that says that the way in which factors are grouped does not change the sum. This property lets you group the numbers in easy-to-remember facts.</p>
<p>2 +( 3 + 3) + 4 = 2 +(6 + 4)</p>
<p>The associative property and substitution allow you to break a hard problem into one that is easier for you. The problem above is now easier.</p>
<p>5 + 7 = 2 + 10</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="card">
<div class="card-header">
<h2 class="card-title"><strong>Make a Ten</strong></h2>
</div>
<div class="collapse">
<div class="card-body">
<p>Because of the way we used substitution and the associative property above, we were able to group the numbers to “<strong>make a ten</strong>”.&nbsp; Here is another example below.</p>
<p>17 + 25 = 10 + 7 + 20 + 5</p>
<p>10 + 7 + 20 + 5 = 10 + 20 + 7 + 5</p>
<p>10 + 20 + 7 + 5 = 30 + 12 = 42</p>

<p>Multiplication also has the same patterns and properties. Five times eight is the same as eight times five.</p>
<p>5 × 8 = 8 × 5</p>
<p><img src="../LiftoffChallenges/Sustainability/Climate%20Kids/Climate%20Change/ClimateKids_MultiplicationTable_CLS.png" alt="multiplication table" title="multiplication table" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%;"></p>
<p>Each number can also be written as a product. Eight is the product of four times two. Five times eight is the same as five times two times four.</p>
<p>8 = 2 × 4</p>
<p>5 × 8 = 5 × 2&nbsp;× 4</p>
<p>5 × 2 × 4 = 10&nbsp;× 4 = 40</p>
<p>This makes a hard problem easy. Six times twelve is the same as two times three times three times four. Changing the order does not change the product. The easier problem is nine times eight. The product of nine times eight is seventy-two.</p>
<p>6 × 12 = 2 × 3 × 3 × 4</p>
<p>2 × 3 × 3 × 4 = 3 × 3 × 4&nbsp;× 2</p>
<p>3 × 3 × 4 × 2 = 9 × 8 = 72</p>
<p>There are other patterns that help us solve math problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>All numbers in the “5s” row end in zero or five.</li>
<li>An even number times any number is even.</li>
<li>An odd number times an odd number is odd.</li>
<li>Products in the “4s” row are double the products in the “2s” row.</li>
<li>Products in the “8s” row are double the numbers in the “4s” row.</li>
<li>Products in the “3s” row are half as big as the products in the “6s” row.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1bg60dnfq2"><img src="../CLS_Template/HQ%20Templates/CLS%20Icons%20-%20Explore%20-%20Color.png" alt="" title="" style="max-width: 100%;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="25" height="25"> <strong>Making Graphs</strong></h2>
<p>Graphs help show data over time. When scientists share information about climate, which is a pattern that happens over a period of time, they often look at decades, or 10-year periods: For example, 1910, 1920, 1930, 1940 all the way to 2000, 2010, and 2020. Using this pattern lets scientists show change over time.</p>
<p>Here is a graph of the number of tornadoes in the USA by decade (every 10 years) since 1950.</p>
<p><img src="../LiftoffChallenges/Sustainability/Climate%20Kids/Climate%20Change/ClimateKids_AverageAnnualTornadoes_Weather.gov.jpeg" alt="Average Annual Tornadoes Graph" title="Average Annual Tornadoes Graph" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>Notice the pattern of tens in how the years are shown. This means that the data is for 10 years, or a decade. The bars show the <strong>average</strong> number of tornadoes every year during those 10 years. Although the numbers on the left side are written in multiples of 5, the scale is 1. That means that the “5” tells us that there were 5 tornados.</p>
<p>Using pictures helps make what is measured more meaningful. These graphs are called picture graphs or pictographs. Many pictographs are also scaled graphs. A <strong>scaled graph</strong> uses a bar or picture to represent more than one of the items that is being counted or measured. A scaled graph will have a key to show how much each bar or picture represents.</p>
<p>In this scaled picture graph, the key states that each snowflake represents 2 inches of snow.&nbsp; Two snowflakes tell us that there were 4 inches of snow.</p>
<p><img src="../LiftoffChallenges/Sustainability/Climate%20Kids/Climate%20Change/ClimateKids_SnowFallGraph_CLS.jpg" alt="SnowFall Scaled Graph" title="SnowFall Scaled Graph" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>Scaled bar graphs are used when there is a large difference between numbers. These are used to compare weather events such as temperature or wind speed.</p>
<p>The temperature graph below is a scaled bar graph. Each bar represents ten degrees.</p>
<p><img src="../LiftoffChallenges/Sustainability/Climate%20Kids/Climate%20Change/ClimateKids_TemperatureGraph_CLS.jpg" alt="Average Monthly Temperature Graph" title="Average Monthly Temperature Graph" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>These scaled graphs show weather in one place and for a given time. Scaled graphs can also help show climate change. A scaled bar graph can show the temperature for the same month over 10 years or the size of a glacier measured every 10 years for 100 years. These would be climate graphs.</p>

<p>Outline your presentation. This helps make sure you cover everything you need in an order that makes sense. Here is an example outline you can use:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Share your main message.</strong><br>Example: Global climate change is a real problem and it affects everyone, even lemurs in Madagascar.</li>
<li><strong>Give background information.</strong></li>
<li><em>What do people need to know in order to understand your message?</em><br>Examples: <em>What is climate? What is global climate change? What are greenhouse gases?</em></li>
<li><strong>Restate your message and share proof.</strong><br>Example: <em>How do we know that global climate change is a real problem? </em>We can see the effect it has on lemurs in Madagascar. Here is what’s going on…</li>
<li><strong>Use data to support your message.</strong><br>Data can be a graph, table, chart, or images. Look for <strong>patterns</strong> in the data that show change. Remember to look for patterns in the time period as well as in the data.<br>These two pictures are evidence of change.<br>

</li>
<li><strong>Share the opposite opinion.</strong> <em>What are the arguments?</em><br>Example: Some people don’t believe in global climate change because it can still be very cold at times. They say... [share specific arguments].</li>
<li><strong>Explain why you disagree with these opinions and arguments.</strong><br>Example: If we look at the evidence, then we see that having periods of cold weather does not change the fact that the global climate is getting warmer. Here is a chart that shows the average temperatures over time...</li>
<li><strong>Share what people can do, now that they got your message.</strong><br>Example: Even though global climate change is happening, we can still make a difference. Here are things you can do to help. You can carpool or ride a bike. This helps because...[share the reasons].</li>

<li>Before choosing your visuals, ask yourself, <em>“does this support my main message?”</em> If it does, then it is worth showing in your presentation. If it is just a related picture that does not prove your point, then it may be better to leave it out.</li>
<li>Try to find data that can be shown in a graph. The graph could show the extreme temperature changes (in degrees Fahrenheit) of a certain place. Then pick a frequency that makes sense; the bar graph could represent every 10 years.</li>

<h3><strong>Climate Scientist</strong></h3>
<p>Climate Scientists<strong> </strong>are people who study changes in the climate over time. They collect data using many tools.</p>
<p>They use their math skills to look for patterns and other ways to identify if the speed of the change is getting faster or slowing down. They look for what is causing the change and what plants and animals are affected by the change. They use graphs to show patterns they find.</p>
<h3><strong>Reporter</strong></h3>
<p><strong> </strong>A<strong> </strong>reporter is a person who is good with communication and writing. Reporters share information with people using print, audio, and video formats such as newspapers, online, on TV, and on the radio. Reporters often use graphs and data tables to help people understand their messages better.</p>
