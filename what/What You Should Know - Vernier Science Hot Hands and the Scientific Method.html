<ul>
<li><strong>Scientific Method </strong>- a method used by all scientists to make observations, gather data, and draw conclusions to answer questions</li>
<li><strong>Hypothesis </strong>- a guess made using the information you already have to answer a question</li>
<li><strong>Data </strong>- information gathered by asking questions, making observations, or taking measurements</li>
<li><strong>Data Display </strong>- a graph or visual used to share data gathered</li>
<li><strong>Data Interval </strong>- a measure of time, when collecting data over time, the observation periods need to be divided into equal measures of time, like 5 seconds, 10 seconds</li>
</ul>

<p>When doing science experiments, it helps to have an organized system that everyone follows. We call this the <strong>scientific method</strong>. By following this process, scientists have a standard way of finding answers to new questions.</p>
<p>There are five steps to the scientific method.</p>

<h2 class="card-title"><strong>Step #1: Ask a Question</strong></h2>
</div>
<div class="collapse">
<div class="card-body">
<p><em>What is the purpose of your experiment?</em> When coming up with your question, think about what you want to find out. It should be specific and testable.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> The question, <em>"Which M&amp;M candy color is better?"</em> is a hard question to test. <em>What does "better" mean? How can we test that?</em> This question will have a different answer depending on who you ask.</p>
<p>A testable question would be, <em>"What is the most popular M&amp;M candy color at my school?"</em> This can be tested by asking the students at your school which color they prefer and adding up each student's vote.</p>

<h2 class="card-title"><strong>Step #2: State a Hypothesis</strong></h2>
</div>
<div class="collapse">
<div class="card-body">
<p>A <strong>hypothesis</strong> is a guess about the answer to your question. It is not important whether your hypothesis is correct or incorrect. The purpose of a hypothesis is to have a prediction you can test with an experiment.</p>
<p>It is a good idea to do some research about your question topic beforehand to help form a well-educated hypothesis.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> A hypothesis for our M&amp;M's question might be something like this: "Based on student surveys done at other schools, we think green M&amp;M's will be the most popular candy color at our school." This is an educated prediction about the original question.</p>

This is where you gather and record information to answer your question.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> To test our M&amp;M hypothesis, we could create a survey that asks each student at our school which M&amp;M color they like best.</p>
<p><strong>A Note on Data Accuracy:</strong> At this stage, you may realize that the experiment you designed does not answer your scientific question accurately or fully. If this happens, it is okay; this is just part of the experimentation process. Redesign your experiment and try again.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> <em>What happens if you share your survey with your classmates and some of the students fill out more than one? Or what if students choose more than one favorite M&amp;M?</em> Your data would not be accurate. One solution would be to create a new survey that asks students to choose only one answer. Then, get a list of all the students who go to your school. When a student returns the survey, mark him or her off of the list so you can be certain that each student submits only one response.</p>

Now that you have gathered more information, you can organize it and find any interesting patterns or trends. This can be done with a graph or another visual representation. <em>How does the information help answer your question?</em></p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> After the students at your school answer the survey, you could take the data and make a bar graph or pie chart to show the results. Once you make a visual, you can easily see which colors are most popular.</p>

<h2 class="card-title"><strong>Step #5: Draw a Conclusion</strong></h2>
</div>
<div class="collapse">
<div class="card-body">
<p>Compare your data to your prediction. <em>Does the data support your hypothesis? Why or why not?</em> Use evidence from your experiment to support your conclusion.</p>
<p>This is also a good time to reflect on the experiment and mention possible sources of error that were not already fixed during step 3. <em>Was there an obvious mistake made during part of the experiment? Was there something important that was overlooked?</em> Nobody is perfect, and neither is every experiment. Knowing where things might have gone wrong or how things could be done better helps improve future experiments.</p>
<p><img src="../Express%20Challenges/Scientific%20Data%20and%20Analysis/Vernier%20Science/Hot%20Hands%20and%20the%20Scientific%20Method/Vernier_M&Ms_CLS.jpg" alt="M&amp;M’s" title="M&amp;M’s" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%;"></p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> A conclusion statement for the M&amp;M experiment might look like this: <em>"Based on the experiment, half of the school preferred red M&amp;M's, making it the most popular color overall. This goes against our hypothesis that green M&amp;M's would be the most popular. After collecting survey results, we found out that almost all of the 4th graders were away on a field trip and could not take the survey. This may have affected the survey results."</em></p>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-8">
<p>After conducting an experiment, it is good practice to share your results with others. This is often done by writing a written report that outlines your steps through the scientific method.</p>
<p>No matter how you choose to share your results, keep these tips in mind:</p>
</div>
<div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-4">
<figure><img src="../Express%20Challenges/Scientific%20Data%20and%20Analysis/Vernier%20Science/Hot%20Hands%20and%20the%20Scientific%20Method/Vernier_Presentation_CLS.png" alt="presentation" title="presentation" width="168" height="168"></figure>
</div>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Know your audience - Not everyone knows as much about your topic as you do. Be sure to give enough background information so that others can understand.</li>
<li>Give credit - Most experiments are a group effort. Be sure to give credit to others who worked on the experiment and to those who provided useful tools or information.</li>
<li>Be honest - Always present your results truthfully. Trying to change your results or change your hypothesis to match your results is unethical in the world of science. Every experiment has its place, no matter the results.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1bg60dnfq2"><img src="../CLS_Template/HQ%20Templates/CLS%20Icons%20-%20Explore%20-%20Color.png" alt="" title="" style="max-width: 100%;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="25" height="25"> <strong>Data Intervals</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Data intervals</strong> are important because they represent how often data is being collected. The Vernier Go!Temp probe uses regular intervals—measured in seconds—to take temperature readings. The data collection settings button can be found on the bottom toolbar. The default setting is a rate of 50 samples/second, which means that every 0.02 seconds a sample is taken. This measure of time, 0.02, is the interval.</p>
<p>(1 <em>second</em>&nbsp;÷ 50 <em>samples</em> = 0.02 <em>seconds for each sample taken</em>)</p>
<p><img src="../Express%20Challenges/Scientific%20Data%20and%20Analysis/Vernier%20Science/Hot%20Hands%20and%20the%20Scientific%20Method/Vernier_DataCollection_CLS.png" alt="data collection" title="data collection" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%;"></p>
<p>If you want to reduce the number of samples taken each second to 5, the interval would also change. To go from 50 samples taken to 5, you divide by 10. To determine the new interval, you would also need to divide by 10. Because our place value system is based on groups of 10, to change the interval you simply need to shift the decimal point to determine the new value. 0.02 ÷ 10 = 0.2.</p>

<h3>Sound Engineer</h3>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-8">
<p>Sound engineers aren’t just artists, mixing and creating new sounds for us to enjoy; they are also scientists. They work with data intervals daily as they test and record sound. They sample the frequency of sound waves and adjust so that it sounds pleasing to our ears. The equipment they use is similar to the equipment you’ll be using, only instead of measuring temperature, they measure different aspects of sound waves.</p>
