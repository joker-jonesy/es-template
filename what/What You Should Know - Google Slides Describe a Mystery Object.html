<ul>
<li><strong>Engaging</strong> - to become involved in something</li>
<li><strong>Inclusion</strong> - including a person or thing in a group</li>
<li><strong>Audience</strong> - people giving attention to something</li>
<li><strong>Elements</strong> - pieces of information</li>
</ul>

<p>Presentations are used for many different purposes. &nbsp;Mainly, presentations are used to display important information with the <strong>inclusion</strong> of videos, audio, and images.</p>
<p>Depending on what you need to include in the slides, as well as your audience, the presentation can include a lot of text and few images, or it can be a lot of images with little text. The great thing about using presentations is that they can be very flexible based on who your audience is and what information needs to be shared.</p>
<p>Example:&nbsp;</p>
<p>The presentation slide below is focused more on images, and the text is in the background. This presentation would be for the audience of small children. Looking at the presentation, you can see that the main focus is on the letter A and words that begin with that letter.</p>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-8">
<p>When making a presentation, you want to draw in the attention of your <strong>audience</strong>. Your goal is for them to want to look at your presentation. To do that, you can include any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Videos</li>
<li>Audio clips</li>
<li>Images</li>
<li>Background designs</li>
<li>Themes</li>
<li>Shapes</li>
<li>Different text sizes</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<h3>Engaging Elements</h3>
<p>By adding different <strong>elements</strong> and making each slide different from the one before, you give your viewers something new to look at. All of the elements provide a different stimulation for a viewer to keep them engaged. Along with the slides, you as the presenter need to also be engaging.</p>

</figure>
<h3>Using Descriptive Language</h3>
<p>An important tip when designing and presenting a presentation is to use descriptive language. Descriptive language is using more details when describing something.</p>
<p>For example, “Jack was really dirty when he came in from outside.” To make this statement more descriptive, you could say, “When Jack came in the house from outside, he had mud on his pants, and his jacket was completely soaked.”</p>
<p>Instead of just saying Jack was dirty, you gave the audience a visual of how dirty he really was.</p>
<h3>Tips on Presenting</h3>
<p>To be an engaging presenter:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Know your topic: </strong>The most important thing is to know what you are presenting about. &nbsp;Go over your presentation, practice, and review any other notes about the topic that is not on the slides.<br><br><img src="../Liftoff%20Challenges/Digital%20Communications/Google%20Slides/Describe%20a%20Mystery%20Object/GoogleSlides_ReviewNotes_Pexels.jpg" alt="know your topic" title="know your topic" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%;"><br><br></li>
<li><strong>Talk with purpose:</strong> Give your presentation in a tone of voice that you would use when having a conversation with friends or family.</li>
<li><strong>Talk with confidence and clarity:</strong> Use a louder and slower voice than you normally would while giving a presentation. That way, your audience can hear you and be able to understand what you are saying.</li>
<li><strong>Make the presentation simple: </strong>Keep the amount of information and text in the presentation to a small amount. Add images that go along with your topic.<br>
<p><br><img src="../Liftoff%20Challenges/Digital%20Communications/Google%20Slides/Describe%20a%20Mystery%20Object/GoogleSlides_ExemplarSenseSlide_CLS.jpg" alt="example of sense slide" title="example of sense slide" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%;"></p>
</li>
<li><strong>Know your audience:</strong> If you know your audience likes jokes, throw an on-topic joke in your presentation. If you feel like your audience is getting bored, make it more interactive by asking questions. As you go through your presentation, you want your audience on the edge of their seat to see what is on the next slide.</li>
<li>It is okay to make mistakes, they happen. Correct yourself or the statement and continue on with your presentation. Keep your confidence up and keep your audience engaged.<br><br><img src="../Liftoff%20Challenges/Digital%20Communications/Google%20Slides/Describe%20a%20Mystery%20Object/GoogleSlides_MistakesAreOkay_Pexels.jpg" alt="it’s okay to make mistakes" title="it’s okay to make mistakes" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%;"></li>

<p>We use our senses to understand and explore the world around us. Our five senses are touch, smell, taste, sight, and hearing. <em>What parts of our body do we use for each sense?</em></p>

<p>It is important when you ask people to vote that you listen to everyone’s response. &nbsp;Everyone wants to have their voice heard. There are a few different ways that have people vote, especially in an audience setting. Along with having the audience voting, you have to find a way to collect the data that they are providing you.</p>
<p>For private voting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pass out strips of paper and have each person write their choice on the paper and fold it up. You can then either collect it or have a certain place where everyone drops off their paper. Once everyone is done, open each vote and make a tally chart with each vote.</li>
<li>Make an online poll or voting question. Then, you can have your audience use the electronic device to log on to the poll and make their choice out of choices you have provided by entering their own choices.</li>
</ul>
<p>For public voting:</p>
<ul>
<li>If it is a smaller audience, you can go through each person and ask their choice. As they say their choice, make a tally chart. If a choice is said more than once, add a tally under that category. If it has not been said, add a new column.</li>
<li>You can provide two or three options that the group can vote from and give them a few moments to think about which they would vote for. When you think everyone has their answer choice, you can have the group raise their hands when you call out each choice. You can then write the number of hands that were raised for each choice next to each choice.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1bg60dnfq2"><img src="../CLS_Template/HQ%20Templates/CLS%20Icons%20-%20Explore%20-%20Color.png" alt="" title="" style="max-width: 100%;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="25" height="25"> Using Data to Make Graphs</h2>
<p><em>After you collect all of the data, what do you do with it? How do you show the information in a way that is organized and put together?</em> There are many answers to these questions depending on what data you collected and what you are trying to show.</p>
<p>To decide how to present the information, ask yourself these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Who am I presenting this information to?</em></li>
<li><em>What information am I presenting?</em></li>
<li><em>How much data do I have?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Using the answers to these questions can guide you further.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>I asked a group of 10 people if they preferred a strawberry milkshake or a banana milkshake. 7 people preferred strawberry, while 3 preferred banana.</li>
</ol>
<p>The best way to present this information would be a bar graph because I am comparing opinions of others.</p>
<p><img src="../Liftoff%20Challenges/Digital%20Communications/Google%20Slides/Describe%20a%20Mystery%20Object/GoogleSlides_MilkshakeBarGraph_CLS.png" alt="strawberry or banana milkshake bar graph" title="strawberry or banana milkshake bar graph" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%;"></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>I asked 100 people what type of elementary school they attended as a child. The results are in the table below:</li>
</ol>
<p>With the given information and the large number, the best way to present this information would be in a pie graph. A pie graph also provides percentages based on the number of overall people who were surveyed.</p>
<table border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100.003%; height: 76.0156px;">

<tr style="height: 38.0078px;">

<p>These are just a few of the different ways to present information from given data. Sometimes, data can be simply shown in a chart with the category title and the number of people who choose that choice next to it. The important thing to remember is that when you are taking data and turning it into a graph or chart, you should keep it simple and make sure it is easy to see the information.</p>
