<h2 id="mcetoc_1bg60dnfq2"><img src="../CLS_Template/HQ%20Templates/CLS%20Icons%20-%20Explore%20-%20Color.png" alt="" title="" style="max-width: 100%;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="25" height="25"> Important Vocabulary</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Crop </strong>- reducing the size of an image to enable use in a document or to enlarge the image to focus a particular part of the image</li>
<li><strong>Factor </strong>- in multiplication, this is a number that is multiplied by another number or factor to obtain the product</li>
<li><strong>Pixel </strong>- is the term used to describe one ‘picture element’ or a tiny rectangular dot that forms part of a picture; all the pixels together form an image</li>
<li><strong>Ratio </strong>- the relationship between two numbers, usually written with the symbol ‘:’</li>
<li><strong>Rotate </strong>- turn around a fixed point</li>
<li><strong>Scale </strong>- the relationship between two numbers used to describe size</li>
<li><strong>Scale Factor </strong>- the factor or number used to scale the size of an image or object up to become larger or down to become smaller than the original size</li>
</ul>

<p>A <strong>scale factor</strong> is a number that tells you how much larger or smaller one shape or number is compared to another. In geometry, the scale factor lets you find the side length of a shape if you know the size of a similar shape.</p>
<p>This means if two shapes have the same number of sides and the same angle measurements, the shape is similar—just scaled up (bigger) or scaled down (smaller).</p>
<p>With fractions and ratios, the scale factor lets you write that relationship in a simple form.</p>
<p>Let's break that down. Any number can be written as the product of two factors: even 0 and 1.</p>
<figure><img src="../Liftoff%20Challenges/Computer%20Graphics/Vectr/Basic%20Photo%20Editing/Vectr_Factors_CLS.jpg" alt="calculations" title="calculations" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%;"></figure>
<p>This is important to know for two reasons. First, because this allows us to identify common factors and therefore simplify a fraction or ratio. The ratio 3:15 can be simplified as 1: 5 because both numbers share a factor of 3. The fraction 12/16 can be simplified as 3/4 because 12 and 16 share the common factor of 4.</p>
<p>The second reason this is important is because we can compare the size of numbers. We can easily compare the size of the numbers if they share a factor.</p>
<p><img src="../Liftoff%20Challenges/Computer%20Graphics/Vectr/Basic%20Photo%20Editing/Vectr_ComparingFactors_CLS.jpg" alt="compare the size of numbers" title="compare the size of numbers" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>The two numbers on top share the factor 6. The remaining factors can be written as the <strong>ratio</strong> 7: 4. In a <strong>scale</strong> drawing, this would mean that for every 7 of one unit, there are 4 of the other unit.</p>
<p>The two numbers on the bottom share the factor 8. The <strong>ratio</strong> is 3:4. Another way to read this is, “the first number is three-fourths of the second number.”</p>
<p>This concept is useful when describing how much larger one number is than another. Look at the example below. Think about how much larger or smaller the product is compared to the first factor.</p>
<p><img src="../Liftoff%20Challenges/Computer%20Graphics/Vectr/Basic%20Photo%20Editing/Vectr_ScaleUpDown_CLS.jpg" alt="compare how much larger or smaller the product is compared to the first factor" title="compare how much larger or smaller the product is compared to the first factor" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%;"></p>
<p>A factor that is greater than 1 tells how much larger the product is. Think of this as <strong>scaling</strong> <strong>up</strong>. A factor less than 1, including decimal factors, tells how much smaller the product is. Think of this as <strong>scaling</strong> <strong>down</strong>.</p>
<p>The product in A is 10 times larger than 145. The product in B is 3 times as large as 75. The product in C is half as large as 64. The product in D is 0.4 (four-tenths) as large as 325.</p>

<h3>Graphic Designer</h3>
<div class="row">

<p>Have you ever seen a logo or billboard that grabbed your attention? It most likely was made by a graphic designer. Graphic design is a form of communication that uses images. The end product can be&nbsp; printed material like a brochure or booklet, or online, like an online advertisement or an&nbsp; entire website. Many companies have a graphic designer create materials that tell the public about their work. Some graphic designers work on social media platforms to reach specific age groups or demographics.</p>

<p>A major task of a graphic designer is to make images fit a specific ‘space.’ This space can be a sixth of paper or poster, a tri-fold brochure, a page in a booklet, or a banner on a website. To make both images and text fit a given space, the graphic designer must figure out how to scale the artwork in the image up or down.</p>
<p>A graphic designer usually has a college degree in art, communications, or graphic design. Others may have gained design experience while working in another area. They often work in teams that can include a photographer and a computer programmer.</p>
<h3>Photographer</h3>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-8">
<p>Taking pictures can be a hobby, an art, or a profession.&nbsp; You most likely have taken many pictures—some that you keep and share and others that you delete right away. Taking great pictures is not easy.</p>
<p>A professional photographer may work with reporters for a TV station or newspaper. Others focus on science and nature. They may work for a government agency or an organization such as National Geographic, Discovery, or the Smithsonian. Some help scientists study nature, such as glaciers, volcanoes, or sharks. There are also ones that focus on people, weddings, or babies.</p>

<p>Many photographers take both video and ‘still’ pictures. The next step is editing. This requires a good sense of what to show and who the audience is. Math skills are also important. There are limits on the size or space for still images and length for videos. Images are sized in pixels. A photographer must know how to scale pixels up or down to keep the quality or clarity of an image while making it “fit” the platform or where it will be viewed. For example, an online photo will not open on a tablet or cell phone if it has too many pixels because the file size will be too large. Yet, just reducing pixels can result in an image that is distorted. The photographer must scale every image, keeping in mind the limits of size and the ratio of length to width.</p>
<p>You can study to become a photographer, but the most important skills are a good “eye” and a quick response to capture the perfect moment. They also have to learn to use special equipment and editing software. Many photographers have a degree in art, journalism, science, or graphic design.</p>
