<p>Solving word problems can be hard. Here are some strategies that can make it easier:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find the question and look for clues.</li>
<li>Draw a picture.</li>
<li>Write a math sentence for each part.</li>
<li>Do the math.</li>
<li>Check your work. <em>Does your result answer the question?</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Look at this word problem:</p>
<p>Alexi is training for a bike race. She rode 8 kilometers each day after school. On Saturday and Sunday, she rode 12 kilometers each day. <em>What was the total number of kilometers she rode this week?</em></p>

<p>Read the problem and find the question. One strategy is to draw a line under the question. Then highlight or draw a ring around any words or phrases that tell an operation, such as “total”, “how many more (or less)”, or “equal shares”.<strong> </strong></p>

<p>Check your work. Does the result answer the question? There are many ways to check.</p>
<p>One way is to use a different operation. In this problem, you can use addition to check.</p>
<p>8 + 8&nbsp; + 8 + 8 + 8 + 12 + 12 = <em>T</em></p>
<p>Remember that the steps for solving word problems are like an <strong>algorithm</strong>. These steps let you tell others how to solve the problem. Just as an algorithm provides the steps you need in order to program a robot to do tasks in a specific order, the order used to solve word problems is important. <em>What would have happened if you added the 8 and 12 first (instead of multiplying 8 × 5 and 12 × 2) and then multiplied by 7? Would the answer be the same?</em></p>

<p>Another quick way to check your work is with estimation. Use an estimation strategy that you can do in your head; this is called mental math. Think of numbers that are “close to” a multiple of 10. In the problem above, the kilometers Alexi rides each day are close to 10. The number line shows that 8 and 12 are both 2 away from 10.</p>
<p><img src="../Liftoff%20Challenges/Robotics%20and%20Control%20Technology/Sphero%20SPRK+/Under%20Control/Sphero_NumberLine_CLS.jpg" alt="undefined" title="undefined" width="574" height="74" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>Seven days times 10 km each day is 70 km. <em>Is this close to 64 km?</em></p>
<p>You can also look for numbers that “fit together” to “make a 10 or a multiple of 10”. Because 12 and 8 make 20, and there are two 12s, put two 8s with those to get 40. Then mentally multiply 3 x 8 to get 24, then add. 24 + 40 = 64.</p>
<p>12 + 8 = 20</p>
<p>2 × 20 = 40</p>
<p>3 × 8 = 24</p>
<p>(think: double 20 is 40)</p>
<p>40 + 24 = 64</p>
<p>The trick to using estimation is to find numbers that are easy for you to work with. For most people, these are 5s and 10s, but some people learn to “see” number pairs, or pairs that are close to an easy-to-recall pair. With practice, you can use estimation quickly to check your answers.</p>

<p>Robots are a type of machine. A machine makes work easier by using a source of <strong>energy</strong>. A robot is a type of machine, but not all machines are robots.</p>
<p><img src="../Liftoff%20Challenges/Robotics%20and%20Control%20Technology/Sphero%20SPRK+/Under%20Control/play_spherosprk.png" alt="undefined" title="undefined" width="364" height="274" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>Some robots are called <strong>electromechanical</strong> machines because they use both electronics and mechanics to get work done. <strong>Electronics</strong> is the science of controlling electrical energy and is needed for ALL robots (and some machines) to do their jobs. <strong>Software programs</strong> tell robots exactly how to do their job and <strong>sensors</strong> help robots adjust to new situations. <strong>Mechanics</strong> is the way a robot is built and how it moves. Robots (and all machines) are made up of mechanical parts. <strong>Mechanical parts</strong> are the physical pieces that make up the machine. Examples include motors, wheels, and gears.</p>

<p><strong>Algorithms</strong> help us to do daily tasks by instructing how to do tasks, the order in which to do tasks, when to start and stop tasks, and how many times to do a task. The images below show different examples of how we may follow algorithms in our everyday lives.</p>

<p>Sphero is a spherical (ball-shaped) robot. Unlike many other robots, Sphero has no outside moving parts: all of its electrical and mechanical parts are already inside of its hard shell. This allows you to focus on programming, instead of building the robot.</p>

<h3>Airplane Pilots</h3>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1bg60dnfq2"></h2>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-8">
<p>Airplane pilots follow steps in order to safely take off. They always begin with a safety check. They use a list, or an algorithm to ensure no safety measure is overlooked. In the air, most airplanes have computers to help fly the plane. When it is time to land, the pilot again uses an algorithm to ensure that all steps are taken for a safe landing.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-4">
<figure><img src="../Liftoff%20Challenges/Robotics%20and%20Control%20Technology/Sphero%20SPRK+/Under%20Control/Sphero_Airplane_Pixabay.jpg" alt="undefined" title="undefined" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%;"></figure>
</div>
</div>
<p>Pilots must understand force—since they face wind, gravity, and hazards— in order to properly utilize the computers to stay in the air and on course. They must also be comfortable with multiplication and addition calculations to figure out how much fuel they need for the length of flight, how many extra gallons to accommodate additional flight time, and total fuel weight. Even though they can often use calculators, sometimes they need to be able to do calculations quickly and correctly, so they use mental math.</p>
<h3>Store Owners</h3>
<p>Store owners use multiplication and addition every day. They use math to know what is in the store. Multiplication lets them predict how much money they will get from selling products. Most stores now have barcodes on items they sell. A computer reads the barcode to know the price. The computer also counts how many of that item were sold in order to keep track of the inventory (the items being sold). This helps the store owner know when to order more products for the store.</p>
