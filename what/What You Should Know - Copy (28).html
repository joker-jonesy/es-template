<h1>What You Should Know</h1>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1csks73891e">What Is Gravity?</h2>
<p><em><strong>Gravity</strong></em>&nbsp;is an invisible&nbsp;<a title="" href="https://ll.creativelearningsystems.com/Home/Title/12-92-756#force" data-html="true" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Force&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is anything that changes the motion of an object. Kicking a ball is an example of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;force&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;." data-original-title="Force" tabindex="0"><strong><em>force</em></strong></a>. It pulls things towards each other. The bigger the object, the more mass it has and the more it pulls. Smaller objects are attracted to and are pulled towards bigger objects.</p>
<p><strong><em>Force</em></strong>&nbsp;is anything that changes the motion of an object. Kicking a ball is an example of&nbsp;<strong><em>force</em></strong>.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1csks73891f"><em><img src="../Liftoff%20Challenges/Mechanics%20and%20Structures/Gravity%20Maze/Introduction%20to%20Gravity/mass_gravitymaze.jpg" alt="mass" title="mass" style="max-width: 100%; float: right;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="281" height="189" /></em> You Weigh Less on the Moon</h3>
<p><em>Have you ever heard that you would weigh less on the Moon than you do here on Earth?</em>&nbsp;This is because the Moon is smaller than Earth, so it has less&nbsp;<em><strong>gravitational pull.</strong></em><em>&nbsp;</em>The force of gravity on the Moon is not as strong, so it does not pull on us as hard and we do not weigh as much.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1csks73891g">Bigger Pulls Smaller</h3>
<p>The Moon orbits Earth because Earth's gravity pulls at it and keeps it close. The Sun is much bigger than Earth. It not only pulls our planet to orbit around it, but its gravity pulls the other planets in our solar system as well!</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1csks73891h"><img src="../Liftoff%20Challenges/Mechanics%20and%20Structures/Gravity%20Maze/Introduction%20to%20Gravity/tides_gravitymaze.png" alt="pull of bigger objects" title="pull of bigger objects" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="443" height="295" style="max-width: 100%; float: right;" /> Smaller Objects Have Gravity Too</h3>
<p>Even smaller objects have a gravitational pull. The Moon is smaller than Earth, but when it orbits close to Earth,&nbsp;its gravity (combined with the Sun's gravity) pulls on Earth's waters and causes tides in the oceans. Even though the Moon is smaller than the Sun, it has a bigger impact on the tides because it is closer to Earth.</p>
<p>Very small objects, like your pen, have gravitational pull too, but the force is weak. We are surrounded by&nbsp;stronger forces like Earth's gravity, so objects with a weak gravitational pull do not seem to affect us.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1csks73891i">Why Doesn't the Moon Fly Into Earth?</h3>
<p><em><img src="../Liftoff%20Challenges/Mechanics%20and%20Structures/Gravity%20Maze/Introduction%20to%20Gravity/skate_gravitymaze.gif" alt="Just like a ball spinning on a string, the female ice skater will keep &quot;orbiting&quot; the male skater as long as her velocity is great enough." title="Just like a ball spinning on a string, the female ice skater will keep &quot;orbiting&quot; the male skater as long as her velocity is great enough." style="max-width: 100%; float: right;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="214" height="214" />Why doesn't the Moon fall into Earth the way that an apple falls from a tree? And why don't the planets crash into the Sun?&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Imagine you are spinning a ball on a string. The string represents the force of gravity and it pulls the ball towards your hand (the source of the gravitational pull).&nbsp;<em>But does the ball fall to your hand?</em>&nbsp;No, not if you are spinning it fast enough. If the ball is rotating quickly enough, its&nbsp;forward motion (<a title="" href="https://ll.creativelearningsystems.com/Home/Title/12-92-756#velocity" data-html="true" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Velocity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is the speed of something moving in a particular direction." data-original-title="Velocity" tabindex="0"><strong><em>velocity</em></strong></a>) pulls the ball outward. The forward motion pulls hard enough that the string will not pull the ball all the way back to your hand.</p>
<p><strong><em>Velocity</em></strong>&nbsp;is the speed of something moving in a particular direction.</p>
<p><img src="../Liftoff%20Challenges/Mechanics%20and%20Structures/Gravity%20Maze/Introduction%20to%20Gravity/physics_gravitymaze.gif" alt="" title="" style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="289" height="247" />This is the same with the planets and Moon. Even though Earth's gravity pulls the Moon towards it, the Moon's velocity is so great that it keeps moving around Earth; it will never fall straight into Earth. Likewise, the planets will always orbit the Sun but will never fall into the Sun.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1csksdv6v1o">About Gravity Maze</h2>
<p><img src="../Liftoff%20Challenges/Mechanics%20and%20Structures/Gravity%20Maze/Introduction%20to%20Gravity/instructions_gravitymaze.PNG" alt="instructional manual" title="instructional manual" style="max-width: 100%; float: right;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="269" height="397" />Gravity Maze is a logic game. You use the force of gravity and tower playing pieces to get a ball to fall from a specified Start Position to the Target Tower. The <a rel="noopener" href="Liftoff%20Challenges/Mechanics%20and%20Structures/Gravity%20Maze/Introduction%20to%20Gravity/Gravity%20Maze%20Instruction%20Manual1.pdf" target="_blank">Gravity Maze Instructional Manual</a>&nbsp;explains all the most important details:</p>
<ul>
<li>The object of the game</li>
<li>How to setup</li>
<li>Steps to play</li>
<li>Building rules</li>
<li>What to do if you get stuck</li>
</ul>
<p>Be sure to skim through the instruction manual so you are familiar with the information. If you have questions at any point, there is a good chance that the answer is in this instruction manual.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1csks73891j">Gravity in Gravity Maze</h2>
<img src="../Liftoff%20Challenges/Mechanics%20and%20Structures/Gravity%20Maze/Introduction%20to%20Gravity/play_gravitymaze.jpg" alt="tower" title="tower" style="max-width: 100%; float: right;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="121" height="182" />
<p>Gravity Maze uses gravity and towers with angled surfaces (ramps) to guide a ball down from the Start Position to the Target. If there is an obstacle (like a ramp) in the way, a ball cannot fall straight down. However, if the obstacle is on an angle, the ball will&nbsp;roll down toward the lower side since gravity is still pulling the ball down. By maneuvering the towers so that the ramps connect, you can guide the ball down&nbsp;to the Target Tower.&nbsp;</p>
