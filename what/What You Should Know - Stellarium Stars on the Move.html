<h1>What You Should Know - Stellarium: Tracking Stars</h1>

<ul>
<li><strong>Celestial Sphere </strong>- scientists use the term celestial sphere to help us visualize the sky because when we look at the sky, it almost looks like every star, planet, and galaxy is stuck on the inside of a big sphere, like the dome of a planetarium</li>
<li><strong>Hemisphere </strong>- Earth can be divided into northern and southern halves, each referred to as a hemisphere</li>
<li><strong>Orbit </strong>- the curved path of a celestial object around a star or a planet</li>
<li><strong>Rotation </strong>- The rotation of the Earth is the spinning of the Earth on its axis</li>
<li><strong>Line Plot </strong>- a data display drawn with a number line that uses an X or a dot to represent each data value</li>
</ul>

<p>If you zoom in really close to see a star in Stellarium, you might notice that it quickly moves out of view. In fact, all stars are steadily moving across the sky together. The <strong>celestial sphere</strong> seems to be rotating around you.</p>
<p>But what is really happening is that the Earth is rotating! As the Earth spins, you and the Earth are being moved into different areas of space. One full Earth <strong>rotation</strong> is equal to one full day (24 hours).</p>

<p>As the Earth rotates, it is also tilted on its axis. This means its north and south poles are not perpendicular to its orbit around the Sun.</p>
<p>The tilt causes the Sun to shine more on either the planet's northern or southern half, or <strong>hemisphere</strong>, at different times of the year. This is why we have seasons and why it is hot in one hemisphere when it is cold in the other. For example, summer in North America is at the same time as winter in South America.</p>

<p>The great distances between us and the stars make the stars appear to move across the sky together. But other planets in our own solar system are much closer. Like the Earth, they also <strong>orbit</strong> around the Sun.</p>
<p><img src="../LiftoffChallenges/Scientific%20Data%20and%20Analysis/Stellarium/Stars%20on%20the%20Move/solar-systems_stellarium.jpg" alt="solar system" title="solar system" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="515" height="322" style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>The Earth's spin causes these planets to appear to move across the sky like the rest of the celestial objects. They also have their own additional "wandering" motion across the sky caused by their orbits. This added motion is noticed over many nights of observation. The word planet comes from the ancient Greek word meaning "wanderer." Thinking about it this way reminds us how a planet's motion is different from the rest of the stars.</p>
<p>The Moon appears to move differently from both the stars and other planets because it is the object closest to Earth and orbits directly around it.</p>

<p>The 24-hour clock, sometimes referred to as military time, uses the full 24 hours to name the time rather than using two 12-hour cycles. After 12:00 p.m. (noon), rather than using 1:00 p.m., 2:00 p.m., etc., the 24-hour clock keeps adding 1 to the hour, using 13:00, 14:00, etc., to represent the time.</p>
<p>The table shows some selected times to highlight the difference between the 12-hour clock and the 24-hour clock.</p>

<p>Time intervals can be rounded to the nearest half hour in order to make analyzing data more manageable. Use the following rules to round to the nearest half hour:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the number of minutes is less than 15 minutes, round down to the hour. For example, 5 hours and 8 minutes rounds to 5 hours.</li>
<li>If the number of minutes is greater than or equal to 15 minutes, but less than 45 minutes, use the half hour. For example, 5 hours and 38 minutes rounds to 5½ hours.</li>
<li>If the number of minutes is greater than or equal to 45 minutes, round up to the next full hour. For example, 5 hours and 52 minutes rounds to 6 hours.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1bg60dnfq2"><img src="../CLS_Template/HQ%20Templates/CLS%20Icons%20-%20Explore%20-%20Color.png" alt="" title="" style="max-width: 100%;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="25" height="25"> <strong>Line Plots</strong></h2>
<p>A <strong>line plot</strong> is a type of data display. In order to create a line plot, you first need to consider the intervals to use for your number line. For example, if your data has fractional values, you might choose to use intervals of&nbsp;¼ or ½ depending on the data. Once you set up your number line, you can plot your data. You will then represent each data value using an X or a dot above the corresponding number on the number line. The total number of Xs or dots will be equal to the number of data values.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you have the data set below and want to make a line plot.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">⅓, ⅓, ⅔, 1⅓, 1⅓, 1⅓</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You could first create a number line split into intervals of ⅓, perhaps from 0 to 2. Then you would place two dots above ⅓ since there are two data values that are each ⅓. You would place one dot above ⅔ since there is one data value of ⅔. You would then place three dots above 1⅓ since there are three data values that are 1⅓. Your line plot would look like the following:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img src="../LiftoffChallenges/Scientific%20Data%20and%20Analysis/Stellarium/Stars%20on%20the%20Move/Stellarium_LinePlot_CLS.png" alt="line plot" title="line plot" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%;"></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are six total dots on the line plot, which corresponds to the six data values.</p>

<p>Scientists and engineers who work in NASA mission planning and control apply what they know about the solar system and the Earth's orbit to plan missions. They collect data and analyze information to learn more about the universe. Line plots and other displays can help scientists and engineers organize and show their data.</p>
