<p>Sustainability is when we meet our needs today without using up natural resources so that people in the future can also meet their needs. For example, a sustainable paper company might plant a new tree for every tree they cut down and use for paper.</p>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-8">
<p>Energy is the ability to do work or the ability to make things move. It comes in many different forms like mechanical, chemical, sound, light, and heat. When you use energy, it does not go away, it just changes from one form to another. We can tell when our computers are using electrical energy and mechanical energy to run because that energy changes to heat energy and we can feel it. If electronics did not release heat and cool themselves usually with the help of fans, the electronics would become so hot they would overheat. This could damage or break the machine.</p>

<p>Humans use a lot of energy to operate their electronics and all those electronics give off heat. When the room temperature rises because of the weather outside, poor building design, or because of all of the electronics being used in the room, a common solution is to turn up the air conditioner. It is estimated that six percent of all the energy produced in the United States is used for air conditioning (energy.gov). Rooms, such as computer labs and server rooms, get especially hot when students are in them. It is not only important to cool down these rooms so teachers and students are comfortable learning in them, but also necessary to keep the electronics from overheating. It can be very expensive for schools and school districts to cool these rooms.</p>

<p><strong>Decimals</strong> are numbers that are between whole numbers. For example, 1.55 is a number that is greater than 1, but less than 2. This number is read as “one and fifty-five hundredths”. <em>What is a <strong>hundredth</strong>?</em> We can understand this by first considering <strong>tenths</strong>.</p>
<p>This grid is divided into 100 smaller squares, and there are 10 squares shaded in. <em>What number does this represent?</em> We can write the number of squares shaded as a fraction of the total squares in the grid. Our fraction would be 10/100, or 1/10. We read this as either “ten hundredths” or&nbsp; “one-tenth”, and we write it as 0.10 or 0.1.</p>
<p><img src="ExpressChallenges/Sustainability/EnergyEfficiency/It&#39;sHotInHere/Vernier_Tenth_CLS.png" alt="one tenth as shaded fraction" title="one tenth as shaded fraction" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>We now have two grids, each divided into 100 squares. One grid has all the squares shaded and the other has only 10 shaded.</p>
<p><img src="ExpressChallenges/Sustainability/EnergyEfficiency/It&#39;sHotInHere/Vernier_OneandOneTenth_CLS.png" alt="One and one tenth as shaded fraction" title="One and one tenth as shaded fraction" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%;"></p>
<p>Again, the number of shaded squares in both can be written as a fraction of the total squares in each grid.&nbsp; The first grid has 100/100 shaded squares and represents a whole, or one. The second grid again has ten shaded squares and can be written as 1/10.</p>
<p>A decimal point is needed to write this number; the digit(s) to the left of the decimal point represent the whole number, and the digit(s) to the right represent the fractional part of the number.</p>
<p><img src="ExpressChallenges/Sustainability/EnergyEfficiency/It&#39;sHotInHere/Vernier_OneandOneTenthwithDigits_CLS.png" alt="One and one tenth as shaded fraction  with digits written" title="One and one tenth as shaded fraction  with digits written" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%;"></p>
<p>This number is read as “one and one-tenth”. Notice that we use the word “and” to represent the decimal point.&nbsp; (This is why we don’t read 524 as “five hundred and twenty-four...this would really mean 5.24!)</p>
<p>Let’s now consider the number we started with: 1.55. The grids below represent this number, as the first grid represents the whole number, 1, and the second grid represents 55/100 since it has 55 squares shaded in.&nbsp; Since we cannot divide 55 by 10 without having a remainder, we simply leave it as 55/100, or .55.&nbsp; We read this number as “one and fifty-five hundredths”.</p>

<p>When comparing whole numbers, start by looking at the digits in the greatest place value.</p>
<ul>
<li>If they are the same, move one place value to the right.</li>
<li>If they are different, compare those digits to determine which number is larger.</li>
<li>If the first two digits are the same, keep moving one place value to the right until you have two digits that are different; you can then compare those digits to determine the larger number.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>The same process is used when comparing decimals.</p>
<p>Compare: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;5.04 and 5.40<br>Both numbers have a ‘5’ in the ones place; move to the tenths place.<br>5.04 and 5.40<br>The numbers are different, so you can compare.<br>0 &lt; 4<br>Therefore,<br>5.04 &lt; 5.40</p>

<h3>Climate Change</h3>
<p>Climate change, using too much energy, and air and water pollution impact the sustainability of the environment in a negative way. Environmental scientists use their knowledge to work on problems in the environment to protect both people and the planet. They help clean up polluted areas, help the government to come up with rules and laws that help the environment, and work with big companies to see how they can reduce their waste and use of energy.</p>
