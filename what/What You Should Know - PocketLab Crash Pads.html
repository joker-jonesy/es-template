<p>Nearly 1.3 million people die from car accidents worldwide each year, according to the World Health Organization. In order to reduce traffic fatalities, high-speed roadways must be made safer. Building <strong>crash cushions</strong> along highways that reduce the impact force in a car crash can save lives.</p>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-8">
<p>Isaac Newton was an English mathematician, astronomer, and physicist who is widely recognized as one of the most influential scientists of all time. Newton made several important discoveries which included the laws of gravity &amp; motion, calculus, and the reflecting telescope. During his work, he came up with the three basic ideas that are applied to the physics of most types of motion. The ideas have been tested and verified so many times over the years, that scientists now call them <strong>Newton's Three Laws of Motion</strong>.</p>

<h3>First Law Of Motion</h3>
<p>Newton's <strong>first law</strong> of motion: An object in motion remains in motion, and an object at rest remains at rest unless acted upon by an outside force. In other words, the car will keep rolling on the floor until it is acted upon by an outside force (collision with the wall) or until friction slows it down more gradually.</p>
<h3>Second Law Of Motion</h3>
<p>Newton's <strong>second law</strong> of motion: The greater the mass of an object, the more force it will take to accelerate the object. There is even an equation that says Force = mass x acceleration or F=ma. This also means that the harder you push a ball the more acceleration it will have.</p>
<h3>Third Law Of Motion</h3>
<p>Newton's <strong>third law</strong> of motion: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction (a reaction is a force, which is a push or a pull.) For example, when you put a book on a table, the weight of the book pushes down on the table (the action). The table pushes back on the book (the reaction), with an equal force that acts in the opposite direction. This force is what prevents the book from falling to the floor.</p>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-8">
<p>An object that is moving has momentum, and an object that is not moving has zero momentum. The faster the object moves, the more momentum it has. A force is required to change an object’s momentum. A force applied to an object can cause it to slow down, speed up, or change direction. To change the object’s momentum (speed) more quickly, a larger force is required.</p>

<p>Because the speed or direction of the object changes when a force is applied to it, the object undergoes an acceleration that is related to how quickly its speed changes over time. The PocketLab contains an accelerometer, which measures the change in speed over time, or <strong>acceleration</strong>. You can use information from an accelerometer to figure out the force applied to an object if you know how heavy the object is.</p>
<p>To understand force and acceleration, think about a car approaching an intersection. If the car is traveling at 30 miles per hour, and the driver sees the light change from green to red, and then slows down gradually by using the brakes for a long time to stop the car, the driver feels a force (acceleration). If instead, the driver sees the light change at the last second, slams on the brakes, and comes to a stop very quickly, the driver feels a larger force (acceleration). Both cars have the same change in momentum and speed (from 30 miles per hour to zero), and they will both come to a stop. Yet the car that had to brake quickly requires more force to come to a stop in a shorter amount of time.</p>

<p>To convert a <strong>measurement</strong> means to change a <strong>measurement</strong> from one <strong>unit</strong>, like centimeters, to another unit, like meters.</p>
<p>To convert units, an appropriate <strong>conversion factor</strong> is necessary. For the relationship between centimeters and meters, we know that 1 m is equivalent to 100 cm.</p>
<ul>
<li>Changing meters to centimeters requires multiplying by 100. Since centimeters are smaller than meters, you will need more of them to equal the larger unit.<br>For example, 5 meters is equivalent to 5×100=500 centimeters.</li>
<li>Changing centimeters to meters requires dividing by 100.<br>For example, 89 centimeters is equivalent to 89÷100=0.89 meters.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="../Liftoff%20Challenges/Scientific%20Data%20and%20Analysis/PocketLab/Crash%20Cushions/Pocketlab_Sensor_CLS.jpg" alt="PocketLab sensor" title="PocketLab sensor" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="253" height="266" style="max-width: 100%; float: right;">A PocketLab Voyager sensor will be used to collect data on the acceleration of the car so that you can compare both the effects of ramp height on acceleration and the effectiveness or how well each crash cushion worked.</p>
<p>You can use either the “Acceleration” graph (which shows acceleration on all 3 axes of the PocketLab Voyager), or the “Acceleration Scalar” graph (which shows the total acceleration of all 3 axes). The “Acceleration Scalar” graph will be easier to read.</p>
<p><img src="../Liftoff%20Challenges/Scientific%20Data%20and%20Analysis/PocketLab/Crash%20Cushions/PocketLab_Data_CLS.jpg" alt="data chart" title="data chart" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%;"></p>
<p>The first step in collecting data must always be to get a control value. A control value is something that doesn't change. It remains the same throughout the entire experiment. This is important to prove that the crash cushion you make is the best at slowing down or minimizing the force of your cart crashing into the wall.</p>
<p>Your control value in the crash cushion experiment will be the height of the ramp at the starting point. The length of the ramp and the distance of the ramp from the wall will also remain the same. Before determining how high your ramp will be, you will conduct several trials to compare the acceleration of the cart or toy car in relation to the beginning height of the ramp. To determine ramp heights, you will need to convert the measurements provided into centimeters.</p>
<p>To run a controlled <strong>trial</strong>, just have your cart crash straight into the wall, without a cushion. This is so you can know what the forces and accelerations look like on the graph without any kind of cushioning, and so that you have values with which to compare your cushioned trials. You will be able to tell which crash cushion works best if you know what happens to the cart when it has no crash cushion for protection.</p>

<p>Read and record the spike in the graphs that show points in time where the PocketLab Voyager sensor experiences a sharp change in acceleration, like when the cart crashes. <em>Can you see on your graph where the cart crashes?</em> Record the number for the max acceleration for each trial on a table. The spike showing the crash is usually the largest and found near the end of the timeline. You can press the record button each time you run a trial.</p>
<p>Remember, to ensure your data collection is accurate, you will need to run a few control trials. When recording data for your crash cushion trials, you will do the same thing that you did for the control trials, but place the crash cushion you've designed in front of the crash barrier first.</p>

<p>To find the average or center of your data tables add up all of your max accelerations and divide by the number of trials. This will help you find the center of your data and help you pick which crash cushion was the best.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1bg60dnfq2"><img src="../CLS_Template/HQ%20Templates/CLS%20Icons%20-%20Explore%20-%20Color.png" alt="" title="" style="max-width: 100%;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="25" height="25"> <strong>Finding the Average</strong></h2>
<p>An average is a number that represents the typical answer for a set of data. The average is an important number to find because it will give you an idea of how your cart will perform, even after you stop conducting tests.</p>
<p>To calculate the average, use the following formula:</p>
<p><em><img src="../Liftoff%20Challenges/Scientific%20Data%20and%20Analysis/PocketLab/Crash%20Cushions/PocketLab_CalculateAverage_CLS.PNG" alt="formula to calculate average = sum of all your values divided by the number of values" title="formula to calculate average = sum of all your values divided by the number of values" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></em></p>
<p>The formula tells you to add all of your data values and then divide by the number of values.</p>
<p>For example, suppose the table shows the acceleration of a cart for three trials.</p>
<table border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 96.2312%; height: 142px;">
<tbody>
<tr style="height: 41px;">

<tr style="height: 41px;">
<td style="width: 49.9347%; height: 41px;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Trial 1</span></td>
<td style="width: 49.9347%; height: 41px;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">0.80 m/s<sup>2</sup></span></td>
</tr>
<tr style="height: 41px;">
<td style="width: 49.9347%; height: 41px;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Trial 2</span></td>
<td style="width: 49.9347%; height: 41px;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">0.76 m/s<sup>2</sup></span></td>
</tr>
<tr style="height: 41px;">
<td style="width: 49.9347%; height: 41px;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">Trial 3</span></td>
<td style="width: 49.9347%; height: 41px;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">0.90 m/s<sup>2</sup></span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<br>
<p>To find the average acceleration in these trials, add the three data values and divide by 3:</p>
<p><em>Average</em> = 0.80 + 0.76 + 0.90 / 3 = 0.82</p>
<p>The average acceleration of these trials is 0.82 m/s<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<h3>Automotive Designer</h3>
<p>Conversions are done in many different job areas. Meters are a standard unit of measurement.&nbsp; An automotive designer, or someone who builds cars, needs to know how to convert measurements from centimeters to meters, inches to feet, centimeters to inches, and so on. Since materials can be measured in different units, it is important to be able to convert when necessary.</p>
