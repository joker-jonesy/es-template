<p>The Tello Drone is a small quadcopter, meaning it has four motors connected to propellers that allow it to fly in any direction. The propellers on quadcopters rotate in two different directions to overcome the tendency to twist in the air. The force created by the propeller blades rotating in opposite directions is canceled out, which keeps the drone steady while in flight.</p>
<p>The propellers spin just like on a helicopter, but they do not tilt to change the direction in which the drone moves. <em>How does it fly in different directions, then?</em></p>
<p>Drones, like the Tello, use smart flight control computer chips to change the speed of each propeller to change how the drone moves.</p>

<p>Download and Launch DroneBlocks App</p>
<p>The DroneBlocks app requires the use of a Wifi-enabled smartphone, tablet, Chromebook, laptop, or desktop computer running Android, iOS, or ChromeOS. Note: DroneBlocks is not compatible with FireOS, the operating system for Amazon tablets.</p>
<p>You can download the free DroneBlocks app by clicking on the link associated with your device or by searching for it in the App Store and clicking "Install."</p>

<p>Tello can be operated with the DroneBlocks app by launching a pre-programmed mission or &nbsp;building your mission or program. If you choose to create your own program, you will select one command block at a time, beginning with the takeoff block, until you have a complete program for your drone.</p>
<p>For the lengthier challenges towards the end of this project starter, it is best to build your initial program before powering on Tello and connecting via the WiFi. This is recommended to allow for optimal flight time because each battery allows for approximately 13 minutes of flight time. Programming and troubleshooting your mission code before connecting saves more power for the flight!</p>

</div>
<div class="collapse">
<div class="card-body">
<p>There might be times when you need to do the same thing repeatedly in your program. Instead of writing the same lines over and over, you can use a loop! Loops allow you to repeat a sequence of instructions many times or until a condition is met.</p>
<p><img src="../Learning%20Launchers/Robotics%20and%20Control%20Technology/Tello/Programming%20with%20DroneBlocks%20(L1)/Tello_Loops_CLS.png" alt="DroneBlocks program loop" title="DroneBlocks program loop" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%;"></p>
<p>In DroneBlocks, the loop command is known as the "repeat" block. You can use this block to multiply a series of flips and revisit the box mission to simplify the code. <em>How can you problem-solve and program using fewer commands by using the loop block?</em></p>
<p>Quick Challenge: Program your drone to fly in a square. <em>How many code blocks does it take without using the repeat block?

<p>A combination of loops is called a nested loop. The most common type of nested loops will be one loop inside another. The first loop is called the outer loop, while the second loop is called the inner loop. The outer loop always performs first, and the inner loop performs inside the outer loop each time the outer loop performs once.</p>

<div class="card-body">
<p>Conditionals are basic “if, then” logic statements that determine how a computer executes or carries out a program. Conditionals are a key part of the decision-making process for computers. They tell computers what to do based on whether a condition or statement is true or false.</p>
<p><img src="../Learning%20Launchers/Robotics%20and%20Control%20Technology/Tello/Programming%20with%20DroneBlocks%20(L1)/Tello_Conditionals_CLS.png" alt="DroneBlocks conditional statements" title="DroneBlocks conditional statements" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%;"></p>
<p>Example: Conditional statements are part of our everyday lives. As people, we can think about situations and make decisions based on what we observe or know to be true.</p>
<p><img src="../Learning%20Launchers/Robotics%20and%20Control%20Technology/Tello/Programming%20with%20DroneBlocks%20(L1)/Tello_DecisionTree_CLS.png" alt="decision tree" title="decision tree" width="201" height="293" style="float: left;">For example, “If it is raining out, then we will have recess inside. If it is NOT raining out, then we will have recess outside.” Since computers are machines that can’t do anything without us directing them, we direct the computer using conditional statements. This tells the computer what to do and when to do it.</p>
<p>Think about the route your drone might be taking to deliver the item. <em>When might you have to program your drone using a conditional statement? What obstacles might get in the way of their mission? How can you ensure that your drone will use safety precautions while it is en route?</em></p>

<p>A <strong>coordinate plane</strong> is a plane constructed when a vertical (<em>y</em>-axis) number line and a horizontal (<em>x</em>-axis) number line intersect at a point (origin). It is made up of four areas known as <strong>quadrants</strong>.</p>
<p>An <strong>ordered pair</strong> is a set of two numbers that represent the horizontal (the first number) and vertical (the second number) placement of a point on the coordinate plane, represented as (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>), also referred to as coordinates.</p>
<p><img src="../Learning%20Launchers/Robotics%20and%20Control%20Technology/Tello/Programming%20with%20DroneBlocks%20(L1)/Tello_CoordinatePlane_CLS.png" alt="coordinates on a coordinate plane" title="coordinates on a coordinate plane" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%;"></p>
<ol>
<li>Start at the <strong>origin</strong> (0,0)</li>
<li>Move right or left (along the <strong><em>x</em>-axis</strong>)</li>
<li>Then, move up or down (along the <strong><em>y</em>-axis</strong>)</li>
</ol>
<p>NOTE: It must be followed in this order, or the ordered pair will be reversed.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1bg60dnfq2"><img src="/content/enforced/6742-CLS-5-2021/CLS_Template/HQ%20Templates/CLS%20Icons%20-%20Explore%20-%20Color.png" alt="" title="" style="max-width: 100%;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="25" height="25">Finding Distance Using Coordinates and Absolute Value</h2>
<p><img src="../Learning%20Launchers/Robotics%20and%20Control%20Technology/Tello/Programming%20with%20DroneBlocks%20(L1)/Tello_CoordinatePlane_CLS.png" alt="coordinates on a coordinate plane" title="coordinates on a coordinate plane" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%;"></p>
<p>If two <strong>ordered pairs</strong> have the same <strong><em>x</em>-value</strong>, we can count to find the distance between the two points.</p>
<p>For example, the <strong>ordered pairs</strong> (5,2) and (5, -4) have the same <strong><em>x</em>-value</strong>. Using the <strong>coordinate plane</strong>, start at one of these <strong>ordered pairs</strong> and count up or down to learn the distance between the two points. The distance between these <strong>ordered pairs</strong> is six units.</p>
<p>Additionally, the distance can be calculated using <strong>absolute value</strong>. (5, 2) is |2| meaning it is 2 units above the <strong><em>x</em>-axis</strong>. (5, -4) is |-4|, meaning it is four units below the <strong><em>x</em>-axis</strong>. Therefore, the distance between the two ordered pairs is |2| + |-4| = 6 <em>units</em>.</p>
<p>The ordered pairs (-2, -4) and (5, -4) have the same <strong><em>y</em>-value</strong>. <em>Using the coordinate plane, what is the distance? 7 units.</em></p>
<p>Using the <strong>absolute value</strong> method, (-2, -4) is |-2|, meaning it is 2 units to the left of the <strong><em>y</em>-axis</strong>. (5, -4) is |-4| meaning it is 5 units to the right of the <strong><em>y</em>-axis</strong>. Therefore, the distance between the two ordered pairs is |-2| + |5| = 7.</p>

<h3>Medical Deliveries</h3>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-8">
<p>Drones can be used to transport medicine like vaccines and prescriptions. Medical deliveries have become one of the best uses for drone delivery because they can more easily fly into and out of remote or faraway places than trucks or motorcycles. Maps are utilized to determine locations, distance, and other important details to ensure the accurate delivery of medicines.</p>

<h3>Food Deliveries</h3>
<p>Drones have been proposed or suggested as a solution for the quick delivery of prepared foods like pizzas, tacos, and frozen beverages.</p>
<p>In San Francisco, the creators of Tacocopter are using drones to deliver tacos with the help of a smartphone app. This service is currently in beta testing, which means they're testing it with a small group of real customers.</p>
<h3>Package Deliveries</h3>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-8">
<p>Drones have been used to deliver packages since 2016. Big companies like Amazon, Google, and DHL have been using this service to deliver packages all over the United States. The Drone package delivery services are seen as a tool for improving package delivery in hard-to-reach areas. It is important for the companies to use tools such as coordinate planes/maps to plan delivery routes, the distance between locations, estimated delivery times, and more.</p>

<h3>First Responder</h3>
<p>Drones are supporting our community heroes by providing rescuers with live video streams that allow them to evaluate risky situations. First responders use drone operators to help locate people who are missing in an area that is too large to cover by foot. At the same time, firefighters and police officers assign drones to discover people in danger and find the safest path to safety during life-threatening situations. First responders can use a coordinate plane to map out their route at the start of their rescue mission.</p>
<h3>Photographer</h3>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-8">
<p>Photographers can get aerial photographs. These sky-high snapshots are a great way for novice or new photographers to set their portfolios apart from the rest. Whether it’s shooting for weddings, corporate events, or just artistic curiosity, drone photography has become a popular request. Even real estate agencies look to photographers to shoot from above ground and get a 360° view of their properties.</p>

<h3>Wildlife Conservationist</h3>
<p>The greatest advantage of drones is the ability to travel to places that are too distant or dangerous for a human to visit. Wildlife conservationists use UAVs to monitor and protect fragile species all around the world. Wildlife conservationists can utilize coordinate planes to document these species’ locations in order to more easily find the species each day, week, or month to monitor their activity and safety.</p>
<h3>Real Estate Agent</h3>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-8">
<p>Many real estate listings now feature a high-definition video that takes you soaring over the rooftop of a house down to the backyard, then in through the open back door, and up the stairs to the master bedroom. Drones allow real estate agents to quickly capture much of the visuals they need to show off the features of a property.</p>

<h3>Journalist</h3>
<p>Traditionally, journalists would have to fly expensive news choppers or use bulky camera equipment to report on stories in hard-to-reach places. But now, drones with high-quality cameras allow reporters to cover news events happening in real-time and in areas previously considered inaccessible.</p>
<p>Over the last few years, drones have become a common tool for journalism, and aerial shots captured by drones have helped us understand how a flood has damaged an area, how large a crowd is during a major event, or even how far a wildfire has spread.</p>
