<ul>
<li><strong>Coordinate Plane</strong> - the coordinate plane is a two-dimensional grid formed by two perpendicular number lines called the x-axis and y-axis - the x-axis runs horizontally from left to right and the y-axis runs vertically from bottom to top</li>
<li><strong>1st Quadrant</strong> - top right section of a coordinate plane where all values both x and y are positive</li>
<li><strong>Absolute Value</strong> - absolute value represents the distance of a number from zero on a number line, regardless of its direction</li>
<li><strong>Part 107 Commerical Remote Pilot Certificate</strong> - the certification required to legally pilot a drone for commercial purposes (professional use, not as a hobby)</li>
<li><strong>Situational Awareness</strong> - understanding what’s happening around you and anticipating what might come next</li>
<li><strong>Thermal Imaging</strong> - using a special camera to see how hot or cold things are - it helps us find warm and cool spots that our eyes can't see</li>
<li><strong>Emergency Medical Responder (EMR)</strong> - highly trained first responder who provides immediate medical care in emergency situations</li>
<li><strong>CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation)</strong> - the act of manually pumping the heart (chest compressions) and rescue breathing (mouth-to-mouth) during cardiac arrest (when the heart stops beating properly) and/or if someone stops breathing</li>
<li><strong>First Aid</strong> - immediate medical help given to a sick or injured person to keep them alive or prevent worsening of the condition until advanced medical treatment is possible</li>
</ul>

<p>Picture a whiteboard with two number lines crossing at the center. One goes left-right (the x-axis), the other goes up-down (the y-axis). Every point on this whiteboard has a unique address given by two numbers: its x-coordinate and its y-coordinate. This "address system" is the <strong>coordinate plane</strong>. The top right section is also referred to as the <strong>1st quadrant</strong>. This is the section of the coordinate plane where all numbers are positive values. This is also the section you will use when drawing and connecting coordinates to design your obstacle course path.</p>
<p>Calculating distance between two addresses is easy if they share the same street (either x or y):</p>
<ul>
<li>Same x-coordinate: Take the absolute difference of the y-coordinates. Example: Points (3, 2) and (3, 5) are 3 spaces apart&nbsp;<math title="" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><semantics><mstyle><mfenced><mrow><mn>5</mn><mo>-</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow></mfenced><mo>=</mo><mn>3</mn></mstyle><annotation encoding="wiris">{"version":"1.1","math":"&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mfenced&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mn&gt;5&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mo&gt;-&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mn&gt;2&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;/mfenced&gt;&lt;mo&gt;=&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mn&gt;3&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/math&gt;"}</annotation></semantics></math>.</li>

<p>It's like measuring the distance between two houses on the same street—you only need to count the house numbers between them. Remember: <strong>absolute value</strong> makes sure the distance is always positive, even if the coordinates go in opposite directions.</p>
<p>For distances on streets that are different (diagonal), there's a fancier formula, but you don't need it for these cases! Just look at the shared street and count the spaces.</p>

<h3>Search and Rescue Drone Pilots</h3>
</div>
</div>
<p>Search and rescue drone pilots are lifesavers in the sky. They use drones equipped with cameras and sensors to locate missing people in vast or dangerous areas. There are three basic requirements to becoming a search and rescue drone pilot:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get Licensed:
<ul>
<li>Like all commercial drone pilots, a search and rescue pilot needs to earn an FAA <strong>Part 107 Commercial Remote Pilot Certificate</strong>. To earn this certificate, you need to study for and pass a knowledge test.</li>
<li>Depending on the organization you want to work for, you may also need to earn additional specialized search and rescue certifications.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Get Trained:
<ul>
<li>You will need Search and Rescue Drone Training, which includes piloting skills, <strong>situational awareness</strong>, <strong>thermal imaging</strong>, data analysis, and mission planning.</li>
<li>You may also need <strong>Emergency Medical Responder (EMR)</strong> or <strong>CPR/First Aid</strong> training since basic medical knowledge can be valuable in search and rescue situations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gain Experience: Experience is critical, so volunteer with search and rescue teams, shadow drone pilots, and network with professionals. Make sure that this is really the career for you as you gain practical experience.<img src="../Liftoff%20Challenges/Robotics%20and%20Control%20Technology/CoDrone%20EDU/Obstacle%20Course/CoDrone_Search_Pexels.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Drone flying above trees in a faraway location" title="Drone flying above trees in a faraway location" width="803" height="487"></li>
</ol>
<h3>The Power of Coordinates</h3>
<p>Coordinates are a search and rescue drone pilot’s digital compass, guiding them and ground teams to where help is needed most.</p>
<p>Here's how coordinates assist drone pilots:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Planning missions</strong>: Before takeoff, pilots input search areas using coordinates, defining precise flight paths for efficient coverage.</li>
<li><strong>Navigating terrain: </strong>During flight, drones rely on GPS data, including coordinates, to stay on track, especially in challenging environments like mountains or disaster zones.</li>
<li><strong>Locating targets</strong>: Cameras and sensors capture images and data, while onboard software analyzes them based on a pre-defined search and target descriptions. When a possible match is identified, coordinates pinpoint its location for ground teams to reach.</li>
<li><strong>Coordinating rescues</strong>: Rescue efforts often involve multiple units on the ground and in the air. Coordinates provide a shared language, allowing pilots to update rescuers on the location and condition of the target in real-time.</li>
</ul>
