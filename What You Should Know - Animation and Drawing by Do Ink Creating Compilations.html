<ul>
<li><strong>Compilation </strong>- a collection of things gathered together</li>
<li><strong>Composition </strong>- a work of art, which could be made from various parts</li>
<li><strong>Equivalent Fractions </strong>- two or more fractions that have different numbers in their numerators and denominators but have the same value</li>
<li><strong>Timeline Tool </strong>- tool in Do Ink app that is used to show when and for how long something appears on the screen in an animation</li>
<li><strong>Pathing Tool </strong>- tool in Do Ink app that allows you to move a drawing around on the canvas as your animation is playing</li>

<p>A composition is something made of multiple elements. In this case, your composition will be made of multiple drawings. For example, you can add background images and move your characters around inside the frame.&nbsp; When you add details to your drawings, you make the story more interesting.</p>

<p>Before you create compositions to tell a story, consider the elements of all great stories.</p>

<li>Characters: The people, animals, or imaginary creatures in the story</li>
<li>Setting: The place where the story occurs, such as a forest, city, distant planet</li>
<li>Plot: Events that happen to the characters of the story which usually include a conflict/problem and a resolution</li>

<p>Example: The Wizard of Oz</p>
<p>Characters: Dorothy, Toto, Lion, Tin Man, Scarecrow, Munchkins, and The Wizard of Oz</p>
<p>Setting: The Magical Land of Oz</p>
<p>Plot: Dorothy finds herself in the magical Land of Oz and must get to the Emerald City to find a way back home to Kansas. The conflict/problem is that she needs to get back to Kansas and she has to find the Wizard of Oz to help her.

<p>Animation and Drawing by Do Ink uses the timeline and pathing tool to help you create your animation.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1bg60dnfq2"><img src="CLS_Template/HQ%20Templates/CLS%20Icons%20-%20Explore%20-%20Color.png" alt="" title="" style="max-width: 100%;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="25" height="25"> <strong>Timeline Tool</strong></h2>
<p>The timeline tool allows you to adjust when an element, or drawing, appears on the canvas and how long it is visible.</p>
<p><img src="Liftoff%20Challenges/Digital%20Communications/Do%20Ink/Creating%20Compilations/timeline_doink.png" alt="undefined" title="undefined" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>You can also use the <strong>playhead</strong> to see what your animation looks like at any point on the timeline.</p>
<p>You can see the timeline for each drawing in your composition by clicking on the object in the canvas or by clicking on the <strong>blue triangle</strong> next to the time marker.</p>
<p><img src="Liftoff%20Challenges/Digital%20Communications/Do%20Ink/Creating%20Compilations/playhead_doink.png" alt="undefined" title="undefined" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>Your background will take up the whole frame and should be added to your canvas first. Your other drawings will be layered on top of the background.</p>
<p>In a play, the actor at the front of the stage is in the foreground. The objects on the stage are in the background.</p>
<p>The photograph below has flowers in the foreground and a building in the background.</p>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1bg60dnfq2"><img src="CLS_Template/HQ%20Templates/CLS%20Icons%20-%20Explore%20-%20Color.png" alt="" title="" style="max-width: 100%;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="25" height="25"> How Much Time for How Many Frames?</h2>
<p>When creating a compilation in Do Ink, it’s important to know that Do Ink plays three frames for every 1/10 of a second. That means that for every second of your animation, 30 frames are played. Luckily, you don’t need to create 30 frames for one second of animation! Do Ink does the work for you.</p>
<p>However, it is important to know that if you ever would like to use the timeline tool to adjust when an element or drawing appears on the canvas and for how long.</p>
<p>For example, if you have an animation that plays for 3/10 of a second and another that plays for 6/10 of a second, then your total length of time for your compilation would be 3/10 + 6/10 = 9/10 of a second. You can add the numerators and place the sum over the common denominator of 10.</p>
<p>Suppose the rate in Do Ink was given in 1/100 of a second. This would mean that there are 300 frames played in one second, very fast! The video below shows a time-lapse video of Earth taken from the International Space Station. It shows Earth from day to night in only 37 seconds; this is an example of how a video or animation can change when the number of frames played per second is sped up.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/CyHiMORy9tU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Time Lapse from Space video here.</a></p>
<p>This next video is an example of how a video or animation may look if the number of frames played per second is slowed down. Watching a rocket launch in slow motion allows us to really see all parts of the rocket as it leaves the Earth, something that normally wouldn’t happen in real-time.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/h0r2tkcOhhE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Slow-Motion from Space video here!</a></p>
<p>How can you use frames per second to change the speed of your animations? Using fractions can help you to determine the frames per second played during your animation.</p>
<p><em>If you had an animation that was 7/10 of a second and another that was 80/100 of a second, how could you determine the total length of time that your animations would play?</em> Just as in comparing fractions, to add or subtract fractions you need to have a common denominator. To find the common denominator, you need to find an equivalent fraction for 7/10.</p>
<p>The picture below shows 7/10 of a figure being shaded.</p>
<p><img src="Liftoff%20Challenges/Digital%20Communications/Do%20Ink/Creating%20Compilations/DoInk_Tenths_CLS.jpeg" alt="undefined" title="undefined" width="310" height="323" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>If we divide each tenth into 10 smaller, equal pieces, then we have a total of 10 x 10, or 100, smaller, equal pieces. Each smaller piece represents 1/100 of the total figure.</p>
<p><img src="Liftoff%20Challenges/Digital%20Communications/Do%20Ink/Creating%20Compilations/DoInk_Hundredths_CLS.jpeg" alt="undefined" title="undefined" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="345" height="357"></p>
<p>The seven shaded parts now show 7 x 10, or 70, smaller shaded pieces.</p>
<p>The area of the figure that is shaded has not changed. We can say, then, that 7/10 and 70/100 are equivalents.</p>
<p>To find equivalent fractions between tenths and hundredths, multiply the numerator and denominator of the fraction that represents a tenth by 10.</p>
<p>7/10 x 10/10 = 70/100</p>
<p>Once both fractions have the same denominator, you can add or subtract!</p>

<p>The <strong>pathing tool</strong> lets you move a drawing around on the canvas as your animation plays.</p>
<p>Tap and drag the green <strong>pathing handle</strong> to create the <strong>motion path</strong> for your drawing.</p>
<p>When you let go, you will see the red <strong>anchor handle</strong> at the end of the path. This shows you where the drawing will stop.</p>
<p>If you need to edit the motion path of one element, or drawing, you can use the two editing tools in the bottom toolbar.</p>
<p>The first tool allows you to <strong>edit the motion path</strong> by clicking on a node (one of the blue circles along the motion path) and moving it around.</p>
<p>The second tool allows you to <strong>add or delete nodes</strong> to the path to increase or decrease the number of curves.</p>

<h3>Computer&nbsp;Animator</h3>
<p><em>Does it sound like fun to create animations?</em> <em>Is this something you’d like to get paid to do?</em> Computer animators do just that - they create animations and drawings for everything from movies to commercials to video games! They use something called a storyboard to plan out their animations and to check that they’re on track when drawing their designs and use computers to create the drawings and animations. Others still use hand-drawn illustrations and use the computer only to animate their work. Either way, if you’re creative, like to draw and tell stories, and want to work on a team, this may be the career for you!
