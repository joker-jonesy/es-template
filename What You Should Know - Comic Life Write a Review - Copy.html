<h1>What You Should Know - Comic Life: Write a Review</h1>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1bg60dnfq2"><img src="CLS_Template/HQ%20Templates/CLS%20Icons%20-%20Explore%20-%20Color.png" alt="" title="" style="max-width: 100%;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="25" height="25"> Important Vocabulary</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>Experience</strong> - an event or something that happens and leaves an impression on you</li>
<li><strong>Survey</strong> - a list of questions looking for specific information</li>
<li><strong>Fraction</strong> - a number that is not whole; fractions describe a part or parts of a whole or set</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1bg60dnfq2"><img src="CLS_Template/HQ%20Templates/CLS%20Icons%20-%20Explore%20-%20Color.png" alt="" title="" style="max-width: 100%;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="25" height="25"> Why Do We Write Reviews?</h2>
<p><strong>Reviews</strong> evaluate the work of others. This work can be a movie, a book, toy, painting, or even a video game. Reading a review gives others a sense of what they might expect. Many people rely on reviews before they go see a movie or buy a new car.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example: You want to plan a very expensive cruise. You look at different websites to find a company you want to travel with. While looking for the perfect company for your needs, you ask yourself these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Does this company limit what I can take on the cruise?</em></li>
<li><em>I’m a vegetarian; can they accommodate my meals?</em></li>
<li><em>Does this company provide meals and drinks inclusive with the cruise ticket, or separate?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>When you look at reviews, it’s important to read more than one. Consider these questions as you read reviews:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>If you find something positive or negative in the review, did other reviewers say the same thing? How many?&nbsp;</em></li>
<li><em>Were they recent or from a long time ago?</em></li>
<li><em>Is the positive or negative comment about something that is important to you?</em></li>
</ul>

<p>While there is no <em>right</em> way to write a review, some might tell you that certain <strong>experiences</strong> need different types of reviews. Some reviews may only give a description of how their experience was. Other reviews may give pros and cons about certain products, restaurants, etc. so readers can choose if that experience is right for them.</p>
<p>For example, how you write a review for a roller coaster is going to be different than how you write a review for a book. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Take a look at an example review.</p>
<p><img src="Liftoff%20Challenges/Digital%20Communications/Comic%20Life/Write%20a%20Review/ComicLife_KBQsCafe_CLS.jpg" alt="review example" title="review example" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>The best thing to do while writing a review is to be honest and remember that everyone is allowed to have their own opinion. Everyone has different experiences, even if it’s the same toy, book, or amusement park. You do not have to agree with other people.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1bg60dnfq2"><img src="CLS_Template/HQ%20Templates/CLS%20Icons%20-%20Explore%20-%20Color.png" alt="" title="" style="max-width: 100%;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="25" height="25"> How Do I Use Surveys to Form Fractions and Other Math Information?</h2>
<p>You will conduct a <strong>survey</strong> and use that information in a visual or numerical way. There are a couple of ways you can use information from a survey.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One way is to look at how everyone rated the experience (1-10) and find the average experience rate. To find the average, add all of the numbers together and then divide by how many numbers there are.</p>
<p>Another way to represent the data is in a table or <strong>graph</strong>. You can make a bar graph based on those who would recommend it again and those who wouldn’t. You can also make a graph if more than one person had the same type of feedback.</p>
<p>Finally, you can share the information as <strong>fractions</strong>. It can be helpful to share data as fractions because it compares one part to “the whole” of the data table. To create the fraction, the denominator, or the bottom number, will always be the total number of people surveyed. The numerator, or top number, is part of the people who belong to the group of the information you are sharing.</p>
<p>Question: <em>Would you recommend that a friend go see the movie?</em></p>

<p>For example, I went to see a movie, and it was not that great. I can provide more facts by showing that <math title="" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><semantics><mstyle><mfrac><mn>3</mn><mn>12</mn></mfrac></mstyle><annotation encoding="wiris">{"version":"1.1","math":"&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mfrac&gt;&lt;mn&gt;3&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mn&gt;12&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/mfrac&gt;&lt;/math&gt;"}</annotation></semantics></math> of the people surveyed stated they would recommend the movie to a friend. That means <math title="" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><semantics><mstyle><mfrac><mn>9</mn><mn>12</mn></mfrac></mstyle><annotation encoding="wiris">{"version":"1.1","math":"&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mfrac&gt;&lt;mn&gt;9&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mn&gt;12&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/mfrac&gt;&lt;/math&gt;"}</annotation></semantics></math> would not recommend it to others.</p>

<p>Many skills are needed in order to be able to write comics. Creating a comic requires some artistic skills. More importantly, making comics requires creativity, imagination, and communicating with others in a written/visual form.</p>
<h3>Video Game Designer</h3>
<p>The skills needed to make a comic can also be used in the video game design industry. &nbsp;Working with video games requires creativity and imagination, but it also requires knowing how to turn animations and characters into a storyline to be played out throughout the game. Being a videogame designer, you would need to work in a team. There are many small details in creating a video game, so it sometimes takes years for one game to be created.</p>
<h3>Travel Blogger</h3>
<p>A travel blogger has to be able to share their experiences about their trips not only through their words, but through pictures. A lot of their stories are shared through photos and showing what they experienced rather than just writing about those experiences.</p>
