<li><strong>3D (three-dimensional) Shape</strong> – a solid shape that has 3 dimensions: width, height, and depth</li>
<li><strong>Geometric Net</strong> – a 3D shape that has been flattened out or unfolded to show the 2D shapes that form it</li>
<li><strong>Polygon</strong> – a 2D shape with closed sides and straight sides</li>
<li><strong>Perimeter</strong> – the distance around the edge of a shape</li>
</ul>

<p>A 2D shape has two dimensions: height (distance from top to bottom) and width (distance from side to side). &nbsp;Any shape that can be laid flat on a piece of paper is a 2D, or two-dimensional, shape. Rectangles, squares, circles, and triangles are all 2D shapes.</p>

<p>A shape that is 3D has three-dimensions: height, width, and depth. Think of depth as a thickness that is added to a 2D shape.</p>

<p>Cubes, spheres, rectangular prisms, cylinders, and cones are all examples of 3D shapes. They have height, width, and depth.</p>

<p>A geometric net is a flattened three-dimensional shape. If you fold and glue together a geometric net, it makes a 3D shape.</p>

<p>Perimeter is the distance around the edge of a shape. Perimeter can easily be calculated by adding all sides of the shape together to find the sum. This total is the perimeter of the shape.</p>

<p>There are many famous buildings and structures in the real world. &nbsp;These exist in different parts of the world, not just the United States. &nbsp;Your state may even have its own famous building or structures. Buildings can be famous for a variety of reasons some buildings play a role in history, while some buildings are important to a country’s government. Some buildings are famous because they are very old. Others are famous because they are important for cultural or religious reasons. &nbsp;Some examples in the world include: the Eiffel Tower, the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben, and even the White House. The Eiffel Tower in France was built 100 years after the French Revolution and was the world’s tallest building when it was first built in 1889. &nbsp;The Leaning Tower of Pisa in Italy was not originally leaning when construction first began on this bell tower in 1173. The Leaning Tower of Pisa attracts tourists because it is still standing despite it leaning. &nbsp;Big Ben in London is a famous clocktower, known to keep excellent time. &nbsp;The White House in Washington D.C. is the home of the current President of the United States and past presidents of the United States.</p>

<p>A security perimeter is a natural or built boundary used to protect a structure, building, or area. At the White House in Washington DC, fencing was constructed to protect the people inside including the President of the United States and their family as well as protect the many gardens and lawn areas from visitors. Some buildings double as a perimeter, the Great Wall of China was built as a security perimeter for China itself but it has towers and rooms where guards once stood watch and &nbsp;tourists can visit today. Some buildings are old and fragile so perimeters of glass or metal allow visitors to still view the buildings while protecting them. The walls and metal fencing installed around the Eiffel Tower protect and preserve the structure itself.</p>

<h3>Fence Installer&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Fence installers install and repair fences, as well as gates and other barriers. Fence installers must calculate the perimeter of the area to secure by using measurements of the distance around the structure. They must know the perimeter in order to know how much lumber or other fencing materials they will need to complete a project.</p>

<h3>Security Personnel</h3>
<p>Security personnel use a variety of tools to protect a structure. A security perimeter is one example of how security personnel use a physical barrier to protect a structure. &nbsp;However, they may also use technology to support the task as well. &nbsp;Some examples of the technology utilized to protect a perimeter include drones, security cameras, and lasers.</p>
