<p>A&nbsp;<strong>quadrilateral </strong>is a <strong>polygon </strong>that has four straight sides, four <strong>angles</strong>, and four <strong>vertices </strong>(corners). It is a <strong>closed shape</strong>, meaning that there are no openings on their edges. Circles are not quadrilaterals because they have curved sides and no angles.</p>

<p>One of the ways to identify quadrilaterals is by observing the sides. Some quadrilaterals have <strong>equal </strong>sides. This means that the sides are the same length.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All four sides of a square are equal length.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Opposite sides of a rectangle are equal length. This means that the top and bottom (opposite sides) are the same length, and the right and left sides are also the same length. All four sides can – but do not have to be – the same length. <em>(Does this mean that a square is also a rectangle? What do you think?)&nbsp;</em></p>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-8">
<p>In the example below, the short lines in the sides of the quadrilaterals show you which sides are the same length. On the rectangle, opposite sides are equal, so opposite sides have the same number of short lines.&nbsp;<em>Why do you think the square has only one short line on all four of the sides?</em></p>
</div>
<div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-4"><img src="Liftoff%20Challenges/Robotics%20and%20Control%20Technology/CoDrone%20EDU/Program%20Flight%20Shapes%20with%20CoDrone%20EDU%20and%20Blockly/CoDrone_QuadsEqualSides_CLS.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Examples of rectangles and squares showing their equal sides" title="Examples of rectangles and squares showing their equal sides" width="224" height="144"></div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-8">
<p>Some quadrilaterals have <strong>parallel </strong>sides. This means that if you were to stretch out the lines that make up those sides, they would never touch. <strong>Intersecting </strong>lines are lines that are on an angle so that if you were to stretch out those lines, eventually they would cross over one another. Some quadrilaterals have sides made of parallel lines, some have sides made of intersecting lines, and some have both parallel and intersecting lines. In this picture, you see a trapezoid, which has two parallel sides and two intersecting sides. Parallel lines are often drawn with arrows to show that they are parallel.</p>

<p>An <strong>angle </strong>is the space between two intersecting lines. The size of angles is one property that can help identify a shape. Angles are measured in <strong>degrees</strong>.</p>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-8">
<p>There are 360° (degrees) in a complete circle rotation (wheel). There are 90° in a&nbsp;<strong>right angle</strong>, which is an angle made by <strong>perpendicular </strong>lines. Rectangles have four right angles. Angles that are smaller than 90° are called <strong>acute</strong>. Angles that are larger than 90° are called <strong>obtuse</strong>.</p>
<p>In the triangle below, you can see one right angle (shown with a square symbol) and two equal angles (shown with a curve and a short line to say that they are equal).</p>

<p>You can figure out the exact measurements of the angles of your quadrilaterals by measuring with a protractor. In the example seen here, the angle of the trapezoid is 45°.</p>
<ol>
<li>Line up the bottom edge of the protractor with one of the sides that makes up the angle. The side should overlap with the number 0 on the protractor, as seen here.</li>
<li>The center mark of the bottom edge should line up with the vertex (corner) of the angle.</li>
<li>Look at where the other side of the angle intersects the protractor's curved edge.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Read the number where the intersection occurs. This is the measurement of your angle in degrees.</li>
</ol>

<p>Most quadrilaterals can fit into one of the categories below. These categories are identified by their sides and angles. When trying to figure out the category of a quadrilateral, ask yourself these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Are any of the sides equal?</em><br><em></em></li>
<li><em>Are any of the sides parallel?</em><br><em></em></li>
<li><em>Are any of the angles equal?</em><br><em></em></li>
<li><em>Are any of the angles right angles (90°, perpendicular)?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a list of quadrilateral names with their pictures. <em>Can you figure out the properties that describe these shapes?</em> Use the questions above as a guide. Click on each tab to see if you are correct.</p>
<p>There are also quadrilaterals that do not fit into any category and have no name. But if they have four sides, four angles, and four vertices, then they are still quadrilaterals!</p>

<h3><span style="font-size: 26px;">Real Estate and Drones</span></h3>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-8">
<p>Real estate agents are hired to help connect properties for sale to the people or companies who would want to buy them. Different people have different reasons for buying properties. A family may look for a home with a big yard near a playground. A restaurant owner may search for a busy location with a lot of tourists. A college student may want an apartment that is in walking distance to school and a grocery store.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-4"><img src="Liftoff%20Challenges/Robotics%20and%20Control%20Technology/CoDrone%20EDU/Program%20Flight%20Shapes%20with%20CoDrone%20EDU%20and%20Blockly/CoDrone_AerialHouse_Pexels.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Aerial view (above) of a home with a large yard and garage" title="Aerial view (above) of a home with a large yard and garage" width="288" height="238"></div>
</div>
<p>One way that real estate agents can show buyers what a property has to offer is by taking pictures or video from above. Agents use special drones that are equipped with cameras to take photos and video. These images can show buyers the surrounding areas, letting them see how close or far the property is from places like playgrounds, stores, restaurants, and tourist attractions. They can also give buyers a clearer sense of the whole property. In one view, you can see a home’s yard, gardens, walkways, fences, roof, and driveway. You can see the layout, whether certain areas need repairs, and where you could put your outdoor things, such as patio furniture or a swing set. Real estate agents share these images on their real estate listings, in marketing materials, and directly with potential buyers.</p>
<p><img src="Liftoff%20Challenges/Robotics%20and%20Control%20Technology/CoDrone%20EDU/Program%20Flight%20Shapes%20with%20CoDrone%20EDU%20and%20Blockly/CoDrone_Aerial_Pexels.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Aerial view of a neighborhood near the water" title="Aerial view of a neighborhood near the water" width="743" height="416"></p>
<p>Drones have become a key tool for real estate agents. It is important to know how to fly a drone safely while following federal and local regulations. To fly a drone legally, real estate agents need to pass a test to earn an FAA Remote Pilot Certificate. They need to know how high they can fly, how far the drone needs to be from people, structures, and airports, and they need to be aware of privacy laws.</p>
<p>Rather than fly their own drones, some real estate agents will hire drone pilot photographers. These professionals are specialists in taking photographs and videos using drones. Not only do they need to understand photography principles like composition, lighting, and exposure, but they need drone piloting skills, an FAA Remote Pilot Certificate, and it helps to know how to use photo editing software to make their photos look extra polished.</p>
