<h1>Do It!</h1>
<p>Your challenge is to build a track with a stable base that allows a marble or small ball to travel from the top of the run to the bottom in the most creative way while remaining on the track. Keep in mind there is no right way to design the marble run.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1em51u3c3p8">Plan the Marble Run</h2>
<p>Plan your marble run on paper before you begin.&nbsp;You can (and will) modify your design as you build it, but it will be much easier if you start out with a general idea of what your marble&nbsp;run will look like and how it will work.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1em51u3c3pc"><img src="Liftoff%20Challenges/Mechanics%20and%20Structures/Lux%20Blox/Marble%20Run/quarter-pipe_luxblox.jpg" alt="quarter pipe" title="quarter pipe" style="max-width: 100%; float: right;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="332" height="198" />Design Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>What is your challenge?.&nbsp;<em>What is your task?</em></li>
<li>Break your overall design idea into a few basic sections and organize them by the order that you will build each section (sketches on paper might help).&nbsp;</li>
<li>For each section, plan out how each part will function. It might take several sketch attempts to plan out a design that seems to work.</li>
<li>Build each section individually to make sure it works on its own. Then begin bringing them all together.</li>
<li>Test, test, and test again! You will likely have to make continual small modifications until you can get it just right. If it still will not work, do not be afraid to completely change a section. You can design a whole new marble run if absolutely necessary (and if time allows), but make a reasonable attempt at modifying your first chosen design.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep track of both your design process and who worked on which parts. Be sure to note what worked well and what did not go as planned in your portfolio.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1em51u3c3pd">Using Lux Blox</h2>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1e04jp1ba12">Lux Squares and Trigons&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Lux Blox have two main pieces: a square-shaped piece called&nbsp;<strong>Lux Squares</strong>&nbsp;and a triangle-shaped piece&nbsp;called a&nbsp;<strong>Trigon.</strong>&nbsp;These pieces can be connected to create many different shapes and designs.</p>
<p><img src="Liftoff%20Challenges/Mechanics%20and%20Structures/Lux%20Blox/Marble%20Run/pieces_luxblox.png" alt="trigon and lux squares" title="trigon and lux squares" style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="514" height="217" /></p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1e04jp1ba13">Dimple and Nest</h3>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>dimple</strong>&nbsp;is the ball-shaped part of the Lux Squares and Trigons. They click into the empty space or "nest" on the other pieces.</p>
<p><img src="Liftoff%20Challenges/Mechanics%20and%20Structures/Lux%20Blox/Marble%20Run/parts_luxblox.png" alt="dimple and nest" title="dimple and nest" style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="407" height="221" /></p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1elsuj209a">Taking Pieces Apart</h3>
<p>Lux Blox snap together easily and hold strong so taking them apart can be hard. If your Lux Blox is too hard to pull apart, try placing a pencil into the center hole to help the piece pop off with&nbsp;<strong>leverage</strong>. Leverage is when you use a simple machine called a lever to help you do hard work. You can learn more about levers&nbsp;<a href="https://ll.creativelearningsystems.com/LLContent/Liftoff/Knex/Knex-Levers.pdf">here</a>. Try not to twist the pieces to avoid breaking off the dimples.</p>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1em51u3c3pe">Design a Tower</h2>
<ul>
<li>Design two towers by creating a sheet of connected Lux Blox.</li>
<li>Fold the Lux Blox. Be sure to leave one side of the tower open.</li>
<li>The tower should be able to stand upright when connected to its base.&nbsp;</li>
<li>You will need at least two towers in order to connect the bridges of the marble run. There should be a slight difference in the height of the towers to allow for a bridge to be placed between them.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="Liftoff%20Challenges/Mechanics%20and%20Structures/Lux%20Blox/Marble%20Run/build1_luxblox.jpg" alt="" title="" style="max-width: 100%;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="304" height="409" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="Liftoff%20Challenges/Mechanics%20and%20Structures/Lux%20Blox/Marble%20Run/build2_luxblox.jpg" alt="" title="" style="max-width: 100%;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="324" height="410" /></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1em51u3c3pe"><img src="Liftoff%20Challenges/Mechanics%20and%20Structures/Lux%20Blox/Marble%20Run/tower1_luxblox.png" alt="" title="" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="197" height="262" style="color: #494c4e; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-size: 19px; max-width: 100%; float: right;" />Design a Base</h2>
<ul>
<li>Add bases to the towers in order to support the bridge that the marble will travel along.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The bases should be stable so that your tower does not fall over when connected to the base.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Connect the bases of your towers using a #7 axle.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: There are many options for designing the bases of your marble run. Try different variations until the most stable base is designed.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1em51u3c3pe">Connect the Bridge</h2>
<img src="Liftoff%20Challenges/Mechanics%20and%20Structures/Lux%20Blox/Marble%20Run/tower2_luxblox.jpg" alt="" title="" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="190" height="190" style="max-width: 100%; float: right;" /><span style="font-size: 19px;"></span>
<p>Similar to the towers you built, the bridges will also be constructed from folded sheets of Lux Blox. Keep in mind that one side will be open to allow the marble to be transported throughout&nbsp;the run. Connect the bridges to the two towers on a slight incline. Take a look at the sample towers, and decide which blocks and axles will allow the most efficient connection.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1em54itefj">Design a Basket&nbsp;</h2>
<img src="Liftoff%20Challenges/Mechanics%20and%20Structures/Lux%20Blox/Marble%20Run/basket_luxblox.jpg" alt="" title="" style="max-width: 100%; float: right;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="133" height="134" />
<p>Design a basket to hold and catch the marbles as they exit the run. The basket will require the use of red or white squares and trigons. It will be helpful if the basket is the same on both sides or symmetrical and has raised sides.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1emch5a94f">Test it Out</h2>
<p><img src="Liftoff%20Challenges/Mechanics%20and%20Structures/Lux%20Blox/Marble%20Run/marblerun_luxblox.jpg" alt="marble-run" title="marble-run" style="max-width: 100%; float: right;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="293" height="232" />Using a stopwatch or timer, measure the amount of time it takes for the marble to be transported to the end of the marble run.</p>
<p>Change the length of your ramp, and the distance between the bases. Can the time it takes for the marble to make it to the end of the run be reduced?&nbsp;Record your thoughts and observations in your e-portfolio.</p>
