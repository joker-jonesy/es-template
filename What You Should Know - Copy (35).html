<h1>What You Should Know</h1>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1bg60dnfq2">Machines and Work</h2>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1dm9qcpc35">Machines Make Work Easier</h3>
<p>The job of a&nbsp;<em><strong>machine</strong></em>&nbsp;is to make&nbsp;<a title="" href="https://ll.creativelearningsystems.com/Home/Title/12-92-985#work" data-html="true" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Work&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is done when a&nbsp;force&nbsp;moves an object, or load." data-original-title="Work" tabindex="0"><strong><em>work</em></strong></a>&nbsp;easier. You can use&nbsp;<strong>force&nbsp;</strong>to make your machines work. A force can be a push or a pull.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, you do work when you push a grocery cart at the store.</p>
<p>Your grocery cart is a machine (a basket on wheels) that makes moving heavy groceries easier. Pushing is the&nbsp;<strong><em>force</em></strong>&nbsp;you apply to your cart&nbsp;(your machine) to easily move groceries (your load)<strong><em>.</em>&nbsp;</strong>You also do&nbsp;work when you pull something in a wagon<strong>.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1bg69s2g76">Machines Need Energy to Work</h3>
<p>A machine needs a source of energy&nbsp;in order to do work.</p>
<p>With some machines, you may be that source of energy, like the man and boy in the picture. Some machines have engines that provide energy.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1bdcadjb53">Gears</h2>
<p>Gears are wheels with teeth that turn together. When one gear is turned the other gear turns too. If the gears are different sizes, they can be used to increase the energy of a turning force. The smaller wheel turns more quickly with less force, but the big wheel turns more slowly with more force. Gears are also sometimes called toothed wheels, cogged wheels or cogs. The cut teeth are also sometimes called cogs.</p>
<p>Cars and bicycles use gears to help them go fast, clocks use gears to keep the hands spinning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a variety of different kinds of gears, but you will be building with the&nbsp;<strong>spur</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>crown</strong>, and<strong>&nbsp;sprocket</strong>&nbsp;gears.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1dm9rmvno53">Spur Gears</h3>
<p>Spur gears are the simplest type of gear. They consist of a circle or disk with teeth sticking out. The teeth on the gears go together to make the gears move. Like the picture, spur gears are&nbsp;<strong>parallel</strong>&nbsp;when they fit together, which means the gears are side by side. Spur gears are excellent at medium speeds but can be noisy at high speeds. You will probably see spur gears in a car window or fan.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1dm9rmvno55">Crown Gears</h3>
<p>A crown gear looks like a crown and can be used with some other types of gears to do work. You will probably see crown gears in blenders, turn-tables, and in egg-beaters. You can tell a crown gear apart from a spur gear because crown gears fit together with other gears at an angle, like the corner of a table.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1dm9rmvno57">Sprocket Gears</h3>
<p>Sprocket gears are usually used with a chain and do not fit together with other gears. You can find sprocket gears on bicycles and motorcycles.&nbsp;</p>
