<ul>
<li><strong>Conductor </strong>- material that is good at transferring electricity</li>
<li><strong>Insulator </strong>- material that does not conduct electricity</li>
<li><strong>Resistance </strong>- the measure of the opposition to current flow in an electrical circuit</li>
<li><strong>Even Numbers </strong>- numbers that can be divided into two equal groups</li>
<li><strong>Odd Numbers </strong>- numbers that can not be divided into two equal groups</li>
<li><strong>Pattern </strong>- a series that repeats based on a rule</li>
<li><strong>Expression </strong>- numbers grouped together with an operator like × or +</li>
</ul>

<p>Electricity is the flow of electrons through a material. For electricity to flow, electrons must be able to travel from atom to atom.</p>
<p>In some materials, like the copper used in most electrical wires, electrons can break free and travel from atom to atom very easily. These materials are good at transferring or conducting electricity. We call them <strong>conductors</strong>.</p>
<p>In other materials, like rubber or most plastics, electrons cannot travel easily between atoms, so these materials do not conduct electricity. We call these materials <strong>insulators</strong>.</p>
<p>Electrical conducting wires are usually coated with an insulator, like rubber or plastic. This prevents someone's hand from getting shocked when touching them.</p>

<p>A prediction is a reasonable guess about what might happen based on information about what has happened in the past. You can make predictions about what will happen in your day,&nbsp; or who will win a sporting event. You can even make predictions when doing math activities. For example, you might notice that each product in the 4s column is double the product in the 2s column. So 3×4=12 and 3×2×2=12. Once you had observed this, you could predict that 4×7 is 28 because you know 2×7 is 14 and 14 + 14 = 28.</p>

<p></p>
<p>You can also make and test predictions about operations with numbers. <em>Do numbers follow a pattern when you add or multiply based on whether the numbers used are odd or even?</em></p>
<p>A pattern in numbers is a result that occurs over and over. We can use this pattern to make predictions about what will happen with other numbers. For example, when we multiply by fives, each product ends in a five, then a zero, and then a five again. Even though five times 10 is not included in the table, we can be sure the product will end in zero by following the pattern.</p>

<p>In an addition table, sums of numbers with the same product always form a diagonal line. This table shows all the possible combinations of numbers with a sum of eight. Notice that in the first square, the sum is 7 + 1. In the next square, the sum is 6 + 2. So in each case moving diagonally, one of the addends increases by one, and one addend decreases by one.</p>

<h3>Predictions in Careers</h3>
<p>Many people collect information, look for patterns, and use it to make predictions for work. These jobs include advertising, coaching, neighborhood and city design, and transportation. City planners make decisions about the layout of a city, what types of services are needed in different neighborhoods, and the most efficient ways for people to move from place to place. They often gather data about what is happening in the present and use it to predict the changes needed for the future. Coaches make decisions about their own players and also try to anticipate the strategies of teams they play against. They make predictions about how to win based on results they have observed in the past.</p>
