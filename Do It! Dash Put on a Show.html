<h3><strong>Plan Your Story</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>Listen to or read this example of a multiplicative comparison problem involving Dash: <br>Example Number Story: “Dash can use its lights to help children safely cross the street. Dash flashes its red light four times to signal cars to stop. Dash flashes its blue light 6 times more than the number of times it flashes the red light when students are crossing the street. <em>How many times does Dash flash its blue light?”</em><br>
<ol>
<li><em>What are the main elements of the number story: who, what, where, when, and why? </em></li>
<li><em>What is being compared in the number story? </em></li>
<li><em>What props and scenery are included in the story? </em></li>
<li><em>What is Dash programmed to do in this number story? </em></li>
<li><em>How could you turn this number story into a captivating scene? </em></li>
<li><em>What could you do to give it some drama, humor, or</em> emotion?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Write out your own multiplicative comparison story that includes Dash.
<ol>
<li><em>What are the main elements of the number story: who, what, where, when, and why?</em></li>
<li><em>What will you compare? What numbers will you use? </em></li>
<li><em>How will Dash solve the</em> problem?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Write a script for your characters to express the story through words and emotions.
<ol>
<li>Notice that in Blockly under Sound, you have the option of using the block “My sounds” to record your own voice and sound effects.</li>
<li>You may only have one Dash to work with, but you can use figurines, stuffed animals, objects, or yourselves to serve as other characters. You will simply have to provide their audio and movements the old fashioned way.</li>
<li><em>What will your characters say?</em></li>
<li><em>How will they express their thoughts and ideas? </em></li>
<li><em>What sounds will they make to express their feelings? (How else could Dash express emotion aside from using</em> sounds?)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Pick your props.
<ol>
<li><em>What props do you need in order to bring the story to life?&nbsp;</em></li>
<li><em>Will you need to include any special math props like a number line or tape</em> diagram?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Design your scenery.
<ol>
<li><em>How will you create the scenery?&nbsp;</em></li>
<li><em>What type of scenery can you use without making it difficult for Dash to move around? </em></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1bg6jemae3"><strong>Program the Story</strong></h3>
<p>You’ve planned your story and how you want to tell it. Now it’s time to get Dash involved!</p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Program Dash in the Blockly app. Remember that you can program Dash to use light and movement. You can add sounds and speech. Using what you know about block coding. Create the moods, emotions, and actions of Dash.</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">The program should be based on your number story and include all of the story elements. Use your story as a guide. Remember that your program’s job is to make the number story you write come to life.</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Test your program. <em>Did it run as expected?</em> If not, try to figure out what you need to change in order for it to run correctly.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1bg6jlt4n7"><strong>Prepare and Perform the Story</strong></h3>
<p>It’s time to put on the show!</p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Prepare your set.</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Dress up Dash. Use fabric, construction paper, or outfits from other toys to transform Dash into character. Take a picture of your main characters all dressed up.</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Practice your story a few times to get your timing down.</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Place everyone where they belong on the set and prepare them to run their programs.</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Run the programs and tell your story.</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Take a video of your performance.</li>
</ol>
