<p>In order for an electrical current to flow, there must be a closed circuit. A closed circuit is a closed path or loop through which an electrical current can flow. If there is a break anywhere in the path or loop, the electricity cannot flow and it is called an open circuit. An electrical path can accidentally be broken or you can use a switch to control the flow of electricity; therefore, an on-off switch is sometimes called a circuit breaker. A circuit does not include wires. All you need for an electric circuit is a power source and conductive materials making a path to and from a resistor. The Squishy Circuits kit can be built to work as a closed circuit. The positive and negative terminals for the battery are the red and black wires. They connect to the conductive dough which allows electricity to flow through the LED light, lighting it up.</p>

<p>A short circuit occurs when the electrical current does not follow the correct path or circuit. In a normal circuit, there is a power source and wires connecting to a motor or light. The motor or light is called a resistor and when electricity flows through it, some of it is used up, making the buzzer beep or making the light glow. Without a resistor, the electricity takes a shortcut (called a short circuit) and builds up in the wires; this can become very dangerous. In a short circuit, wires can heat up enough to cause a fire or explosion. If you pushed the conductive dough balls to touch in the circuit, the electricity flowing through would skip the LED light and cause a short circuit because the resistor has been left out of the circuit. A short circuit could also happen if you touch the positive and negative battery terminals together.</p>

<p>A switch can come in a variety of shapes and sizes. It can be designed to be a button that you push, a slide or a knob that you turn, or even a toggle. All switches are designed to close (complete) or open (break) a circuit, and they are usually chosen for a particular circuit because of the job needed to be done. Switches make it possible for you to control electricity without having to take apart or rebuild the circuit.</p>

<p>Two-dimensional shapes are classified by certain attributes, like sides and angles. Sides could have pairs of parallel lines, which means they are straight lines that will never intersect. Sides could also have perpendicular sides, which means they meet at a right angle. A right angle equals 90°, like the corner of a square or a piece of paper.</p>

<p>A <strong>quadrilateral</strong> is a shape that has four sides. One type of quadrilateral is a <strong>rectangle</strong>. A rectangle has two pairs of parallel sides and all four sides are perpendicular, forming four right angles.</p>

</div>
<div class="tab-pane fade" role="tabpanel" tabindex="0">
<p>Sides can also be <strong>congruent</strong>, which means that they are equal in length. In the rectangle above, the opposite sides are congruent to each other because they are the same length.</p>
<p>Another quadrilateral that has parallel sides that are equal in length is a <strong>parallelogram</strong>. Opposite sides are parallel and equal in length, and opposite angles are equal in measure. All rectangles are types of parallelograms, but a parallelogram is not necessarily a rectangle.</p>

</div>
<div class="tab-pane fade" role="tabpanel" tabindex="0">
<p>A third type of quadrilateral that has parallel sides that are equal in length is a <strong>rhombus</strong>. A rhombus is a special type of parallelogram where all four sides are equal in length. All squares are rhombuses, but a rhombus is not necessarily a square.</p>

<p>Triangles can also be classified using sides and angles. All triangles have three sides. A triangle can be a right triangle, where two of its sides meet to form a right angle. We can also look at its side lengths. A right triangle can have two congruent sides; we call this an <strong>isosceles right triangle</strong>. A triangle can also be a right triangle with no congruent sides; we call this a <strong>scalene right triangle</strong>.</p>

<h3><strong>Line Installer</strong></h3>
<p>Line installers have the important job of making sure that electricity is flowing safely and correctly through the power lines that provide electricity to our homes and businesses. They work to install new power lines to homes and businesses, and they problem-solve to repair existing power lines that need repair. Line installers do a very important job!</p>

<p>Robots are designed to do many of the tasks that humans are unable to complete or prefer not to do. Robotics engineers spend most of their time designing robots. This involves sketching out a design using 2D shapes and then using CAD (Computer-Aided Design) tools to turn their 2D ideas into 3D models. CAD is a powerful tool, even allowing for the engineers to place circuits in their designs to make the robot move. The finished CAD design is then used by CAM (Computer-Aided Manufacture) tools that actually build the robot. If you like computer programming, electronics, and solving complex problems, this might be a career for you!</p>
