<p>Some jobs sometimes require special clothing to help keep workers safe. For example, workers on a construction site, in a factory, or in a warehouse need to wear hard hats, high visibility vests, and heavy-duty boots. Sometimes they might also need gloves, safety glasses, and hearing protection.</p>

<p>Doctors, nurses, and other medical workers wear uniforms called scrubs. In some hospitals, the color of a worker’s scrubs tells others what their role is. For example, a doctor might wear a white lab coat, a nurse might wear light blue scrubs, and a surgeon might wear teal scrubs. This color system can help communicate what responsibilities each person has at work.</p>

<p>Sometimes a job requires a uniform to help workers feel united with one another. They might also have a uniform to encourage confidence in a professional team working to help customers. Workers at restaurants, stores, or even the post office wear uniforms to help customers know who they can ask when they have questions. Lawyers and other people working in businesses wear suits to help their clients feel confident working with them.</p>
