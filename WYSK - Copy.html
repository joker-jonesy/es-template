<ul>
<li><strong>Algorithm -</strong> the standard or regular steps used to solve math problems using a given operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division)</li>
<li><strong>Sum - </strong>the answer to an addition problem</li>
<li><strong>Difference - </strong>the answer to a subtraction problem</li>
<li><strong>Regrouping - </strong>changing the number of groups in each place value to make adding or subtracting easier (example: 37 could be made from 3 tens and 7 ones or it could be made with 2 tens and 17 ones, 1 tens and 27 ones, or 37 ones)</li>
<li><strong>Borrowing - </strong>breaking up one group from the next biggest place value so that you have enough to subtract (example: you “borrow” from the tens place to change 132 from 1 hundred, 3 tens, and 2 ones to 1 hundred, 2 tens, and 12 ones allowing you to take away more than 2 ones from the original number)</li>
<li><strong>Scientific Method - </strong>the organized steps that scientists follow to do experiments</li>
<li><strong>Hypothesis - </strong>a guess about what the results of the experiment will be</li>

<p dir="ltr"><img src="Liftoff%20Challenges/Scientific%20Data%20and%20Analysis/Vernier/Digital%20Data/scientist_vernier.png" alt="scientist " title="scientist " data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="100" height="150" style="max-width: 100%; float: right;">When doing science experiments, it helps to have an organized system—a way to work together—that everyone follows. We call this the scientific method. By following this process, scientists have a standard way of finding answers to new questions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are 5 steps to the scientific method:</p>

<h2 class="card-title">Step #1: Ask a Question</h2>
</div>
<div class="collapse">
<div class="card-body">
<p dir="ltr"><em>What is the purpose of your experiment? </em>When coming up with your question, think about what you want to find out. It should be specific—focused on one thing—and testable.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Example: The question, "<em>Which M&amp;M candy color is better?</em>" is a hard question to test. <em>What does "better" mean? How can we test that?</em> This question will have a different answer depending on who you ask.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A testable question would be, "<em>What is the most popular M&amp;M candy color at my school?</em>" This can be tested by asking the students at your school which color they prefer and adding each student's vote.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="card">
<div class="card-header">
<h2 class="card-title">Step #2: State a Hypothesis</h2>
</div>
<div class="collapse">
<div class="card-body">
<p dir="ltr">A <strong>hypothesis</strong> is a guess about the answer to your question. It is not important whether your hypothesis is correct or incorrect. The purpose of a hypothesis is to have a prediction you can test with an experiment.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It is a good idea to research your question topic beforehand to help form a well-educated hypothesis.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Example: A hypothesis for our M&amp;M's question might be something like this: "Based on student surveys (questions asked of a group) done at other schools, we think green M&amp;M's will be the most popular candy color at our school." This is an educated prediction about the original or first question.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="card">
<div class="card-header">
<h2 class="card-title">Step #3: Do an Experiment</h2>
</div>
<div class="collapse">
<div class="card-body">
<p dir="ltr">Test your hypothesis by collecting data through an experiment. This is where you gather and record information to answer your question.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Example: To test our M&amp;M hypothesis, we could do a survey that asks each student at our school which M&amp;M color they like best.</p>
<p dir="ltr">NOTE: Data Accuracy- At this stage, you may realize that the experiment you designed does not answer your scientific question accurately or fully. This is just part of the experimentation process— the steps you will go through as you complete an experiment. Redesign your experiment and try again.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="Liftoff%20Challenges/Scientific%20Data%20and%20Analysis/Vernier/Digital%20Data/experiment_vernier.jpg" alt="experiment" title="experiment" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="177" height="268" style="max-width: 100%; float: right;">Example: <em>What happens if you share your survey with your classmates and some students fill out more than one?</em> Or what if students choose more than one favorite M&amp;M? Your data would not be accurate. One solution would be to create a new survey that asks students to pick only one answer.&nbsp; Then, get a list of all the students who go to your school. When a student returns the survey, mark him or her off of the list so you can be certain that each student submits only one response.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="card">
<div class="card-header">
<h2 class="card-title">Step #4: Analyze Your Data</h2>
</div>
<div class="collapse">
<div class="card-body">
<p dir="ltr">Study the data you collected from your experiment. Now that you have gathered more information, you can organize it and find any interesting patterns or trends. This can be done with a graph or another visual or picture representation. <em>How does the information help answer your question?</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em><img src="Liftoff%20Challenges/Scientific%20Data%20and%20Analysis/Vernier/Digital%20Data/bar-chart_vernier.png" alt="bar graph" title="bar chart " data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="305" height="251" style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Example: After the students at your school answer the survey, you could take the data and make a bar graph or pie chart to show the results. Once you make a visual, you can easily see which colors are most popular.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="card">
<div class="card-header">
<h2 class="card-title">Step #5: Draw a Conclusion</h2>
</div>
<div class="collapse">
<div class="card-body">
<p dir="ltr">Compare your data to your prediction. <em>Does the data support your hypothesis? Why or why not?</em> Use evidence from your experiment to support your conclusion.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This is also a good time to reflect on or think about the experiment and list possible causes of error that were not already fixed during step 3. Was there a clear mistake made during part of the experiment? Was there something important that was missed? Nobody is perfect, and neither is every experiment. Knowing where things might have gone wrong or how things could be done better helps improve future experiments.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Example: A conclusion statement for the M&amp;M experiment might look like this: "Using data from the experiment, half of the school preferred red M&amp;M's, making it the most popular color overall. This goes against our hypothesis that green M&amp;M's would be the most popular. After collecting survey results, we found out that almost all 4th graders were gone on a field trip and could not take the survey. This may have changed the survey results.</p>

<p dir="ltr">What kinds of science experiments have you done?&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">You have probably measured the temperature of something using a thermometer or the change in a plant's height using a ruler.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The information we collect is called data, which can be used to understand experimental results.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are many tools we can use to measure data accurately. Tools are chosen based on the type of data you want to collect to test your hypothesis.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Modern technology allows us to collect a type of data called digital data using electronic sensors. Sensors take exact, accurate measurements that are easy to compare. Avoid using your own senses (sight, touch, smell, hearing, and taste) to measure data because it often results in inaccurate data. For example, by using your sense of touch, the best you could do is to sense if an object "feels hotter" than another, but you could not accurately identify how much warmer it is. To get accurate measurements in degrees, you should use a temperature sensor, such as a digital thermometer.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We can then use computers to record and help us understand this digital data. Like the ones you will use in this challenge, some electronic sensors can be connected directly to a computer.</p>
<h2><img src="CLS%20Icons%20-%20Explore%20-%20Color.png" alt="" title="" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="25" height="25" style="max-width: 100%;"> <strong style="font-size: 1.875rem;">Addition</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Look at the example below. We will work through this problem together.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="Liftoff%20Challenges/Scientific%20Data%20and%20Analysis/Vernier/Digital%20Data/Vernier_AdditionAlgorithm_CLS%20(1).png" alt="summary of the addition algorithm" title="summary of the addition algorithm" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%;"></p>
<p dir="ltr">The first step is to line up the digits by their place value. Make sure the smallest place value is lined up to add groups of the same size. You will add digits that represent ones together before moving onto the tens place.&nbsp; When adding, align the place values vertically or up-and-down.</p>
<p dir="ltr">After lining up the place values, you can start adding. Always start with the digits furthest to the right or the smallest place value. In the example above, the ones place has the digits 8 and 5. 8+5=13. Since the <strong>sum</strong> of these digits is greater than 9, you will need to regroup. When you <strong>regroup</strong> in addition, you bundle 10 groups of a smaller place value together to move to the next place. The sum, which was 13, can be broken into tens and ones. The digit 3 will stay in the ones place, but the 1 (which is in the tens place) will be moved to the tens place. To keep track of what you have borrowed, you will write a small “1” above the tens column.</p>
<p dir="ltr">You are now ready to move on to the next place value, which is the tens place. Continue adding and regrouping as needed until you find the sum of the equation.</p>
<h2><img src="CLS%20Icons%20-%20Explore%20-%20Color.png" alt="" title="" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="25" height="25" style="max-width: 100%;"> <strong style="font-size: 1.875rem;">Subtraction</strong></h2>
<p>When you subtract, you find the difference between the two numbers. Subtraction and addition are opposites. There is a standard algorithm for subtraction as well. Unlike addition, the order of the numbers matters in subtraction. When lining up your numbers to subtract, the largest overall number goes on top. For example, if we subtract 261 and 123, 261 is the greatest number, so it will go on top. Let’s work through an example together.</p>
<p><img src="Liftoff%20Challenges/Scientific%20Data%20and%20Analysis/Vernier/Digital%20Data/Vernier_SubtractionAlgorithm_CLS%20(1).png" alt="summary of the subtraction algorithm steps" title="summary of the subtraction algorithm steps" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%;"></p>
<p>After lining up your digits, begin subtracting with the smallest place value. In the example above, the ones place has an equation of 1-3. You cannot take 3 away from 1, so you will need to regroup! In subtraction, we regroup by borrowing from the place value to the left.&nbsp; You can borrow from the next biggest place value to create enough ones to subtract. There is a 6 in the tens place. Since it is in the tens place, the 6 represents 60. You can break 60 down into 5 tens and 10 ones. To do that, cross out the 6 and change it to 5. Add 10 ones to the ones place in the top digit (in this case 1). This will change the ones place subtraction problem to 11-3. You are ready to subtract. Continue subtracting each place value until there are no more columns.</p>

<p>Sometimes, it can be tricky to determine when you should add or subtract. Think about what is happening in the word problem. <em>Are things being combined or joined together, or are they being broken apart or separated?</em> Sometimes, keywords can help you choose which operation to use. See the keyword list below.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Word problems often have clues that help you to determine if you should add or subtract. It helps to think about what the question asks you to do: <em>are you combining or joining groups, or are you removing or finding the difference? </em>Let’s look at a few examples.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="Liftoff%20Challenges/Scientific%20Data%20and%20Analysis/Vernier/Digital%20Data/Vernier_WordList_CLS%20(1).png" alt="math key word lists- addition = increase, plus, combine, more than, all together, sum.

<p dir="ltr">Sarah has half of a cup of hot chocolate that is 65°F. She pours more hot chocolate from a thermos—a cup that keeps things warm—which is 82°F. <em>What is the total combined temperature of the hot chocolate?&nbsp;</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>What is happening in this problem? </em>Sarah is combining the temperatures of two different “groups” of hot chocolate. Since she is combining, and the problem asks for the “total,” we know that this is an addition problem!</p>
<p dir="ltr">Let’s look at the same problem with a different question.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sarah has half of a cup of hot chocolate that is 65°F. She pours more hot chocolate from a thermos that is 82°F. <em>How much cooler is the hot chocolate in the cup than the hot chocolate in the thermos?&nbsp;</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">In this problem, the question is asking how much cooler the hot chocolate is. We are looking for the difference between the two numbers. This is a subtraction problem.</p>

<h3>Addition and Subtraction in Careers</h3>
<p>Addition and subtraction are used constantly in the real world! Doctors use addition and subtraction to figure out how much medicine a patient needs. If they know that the most a patient can take is 26mg a day, they can use subtraction to figure out how much more they can give a patient if they have already taken 12mg that day. Some doctors have to report the total number of cases they have of a disease, like Covid-19. They use addition to find the total number of patients who have had a specific illness.<strong> </strong></p>

<p>Truck drivers use addition and subtraction to make sure that they have the appropriate amount of goods on their trucks. They know the greatest weight that their truck can carry. They have to add the weight of the different items they will carry on the truck to make sure that they do not reach the limit.</p>
