<p dir="ltr">Your challenge is to come up with a plan to excite your schoolmates to learn about climate change. Play the games and review the activities on <a href="https://climatekids.nasa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NASA’s Climate Kids Website</a>&nbsp;to find ones that would interest your peers while teaching them something valuable about climate change.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Design your own game or activity to teach about global climate change, clean energy, or another topic found on <a href="https://climatekids.nasa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NASA’s Climate Kids Website</a>. You don’t have to program a working game; you can simply sketch it out using a tool like drawing software. When coming up with the game instructions and features, find ways to incorporate multiplication and division facts. You can also teach your players math strategies to succeed in the game.</p>

</ol>
<h3><strong>Find a Resource for Your Peers</strong><strong></strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">You do not have to choose a game or activity; you can choose a video, interview, image gallery, article, or even a single photo. However, if you choose one of these, you will want to come up with an interesting way of presenting it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For example, if you choose a video, you may ask your peers to guess what it’s about based on the video title and thumbnail. Then, stop the video in the middle and ask your peers to guess what happens next. You can even ask your peers to come up with a different ending.</p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1" style="list-style-type: decimal;" dir="ltr">
<p role="presentation" dir="ltr">Browse through <a href="https://climatekids.nasa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NASA’s Climate Kids Website</a>. Review games, activities, interviews, videos, image galleries, or any other resource that you think would interest your peers.</p>
</li>
<li aria-level="1" style="list-style-type: decimal;" dir="ltr">
<p role="presentation" dir="ltr">Take notes. List the resources you review and briefly describe whether they would interest your peers and why.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li aria-level="1" style="list-style-type: decimal;" dir="ltr">
<p role="presentation" dir="ltr">After reviewing at least 3-5 different resources, choose one or two to focus on. <em style="font-size: 1.1875rem;">What is this resource? What is so interesting about it? </em><em style="font-size: 1.1875rem;">What would your peers learn from it?&nbsp;</em><span style="font-size: 1.1875rem;"> </span><em>Is there a special way you would present the game, activity, or resource to make it even more interesting to your peers?</em></p>
</li>
<li aria-level="1" style="list-style-type: decimal;" dir="ltr">
<p role="presentation" dir="ltr"><em></em><span style="font-size: 1.1875rem;">Review 1-2 articles related to the topics covered by your game, activity, or resource. </span><span style="font-size: 1.1875rem;">After reading the articles, list the article(s) you read and key takeaways</span></p>

<h3 id="mcetoc_1bg6jemae3"><strong>Design Your Own Game or Activity</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">Design a game or activity that would excite your peers to learn about climate change or another topic from NASA’s Climate Kids website.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>You can use drawing software to create a storyboard or game board.&nbsp;</li>
<li>You can draw something on paper and include a photo of it in your Project Submission.</li>
<li>You can also use existing pictures and graphics from the internet.&nbsp;</li>
<li>You do not have to program a working game.</li>

<p class="instruction">Here are some ideas for how to develop a climate change game that incorporates math strategies and facts:</p>

<div class="card-header">
<h2 class="card-title">What will the players learn?</h2>
</div>
<div class="collapse">
<div class="card-body">
<p>What message should the players receive? Check out the What You Should Know tab if you need reminders.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="card">
<div class="card-header">
<h2 class="card-title">How will the players move?</h2>
</div>
<div class="collapse">
<div class="card-body">
<p>Decide if players move forward by tossing number cubes (or dice), or by drawing cards.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="card">
<div class="card-header">
<h2 class="card-title">How will the players get the important information?&nbsp;</h2>
</div>
<div class="collapse">
<div class="card-body">
<p>Plan ‘stops’ where players can read or view data or information that supports the message.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="card">
<div class="card-header">
<h2 class="card-title">What rules will your game have?</h2>
</div>
<div class="collapse">
<div class="card-body">
<p>&nbsp;Create the rules for your game. How will a player know how far to move forward or backward? Use multiplication and division to make players move forward and backward.&nbsp;</p>
<p role="presentation" dir="ltr">For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>For a game using number cubes, put multiplication and division on the game board itself. Each space would have a problem that tells players to jump forward or go backward. Below are some ideas.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../LiftoffChallenges/Sustainability/Climate%20Kids/Design%20a%20Message/Climate%20Kids2_GameCards_CLS%20(1).jpg" alt="game cards" title="game cards" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<ul>
<li role="presentation" dir="ltr">For a game where players draw cards, write multiplication and division facts on each card. When players give the correct answer, they move forward. When players give an incorrect answer, they move backwards.</li>
<li role="presentation" dir="ltr">Remember to build in math strategies that players can use to succeed.&nbsp; For example, if you say “move back 48 6”, you can add a hint that says, “Remember: 6 x ? = 48” or “To remember the 6s, double the 3s.”</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="card">
<div class="card-header">
<h2 class="card-title">What climate issues will you include in your game?</h2>
</div>
<div class="collapse">
<div class="card-body">
<p role="presentation" dir="ltr">Be sure to include climate issues in the game. Make some positive moves where players move forward, and negative moves where players move backwards. For example, you might have “threw plastic bottles in a lake” as negative and “planted a tree” as positive.</p>
<ul>
<li role="presentation" dir="ltr">For a game board using number cubes, add some spaces that give a climate fact or action that can be taken. These could also be spaces that tell a player to draw a card that has the information.&nbsp;</li>
<li role="presentation" dir="ltr">For a game where moves are based on cards, put the climate issues on the game board.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
