<p>Many people are not physically able to leave their homes, and need help shopping for weekly supplies. Your challenge is to program your Dash robot with Blockly to collect groceries for those in need. You will also program your Dash robot to travel to specific items based on the fraction value listed on a grocery list.</p>

<p>Safety Tip: Always place your robot on the floor before turning it on to stop it from falling off a table or desk.</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure your Dash is fully charged.</li>
<li>Pair your robot with a device.</li>
<li>Open the Blockly app on your device.</li>
<li>Connect to the robot by clicking the <strong>+</strong> sign in the upper right-hand corner.</li>
<li>Practice coding with pre-made puzzle challenges in the Warm-Up section.</li>
<li>When you are ready to program Dash to follow your grocery store path, you will need to go to “My Projects” and then “Create New.”</li>

<h3><strong>Fraction Grocery Cards and List</strong></h3>
<p>Dash can be programmed to follow a specific path from one grocery item to the next. For this activity, you will need:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../LiftoffChallenges/Robotics%20and%20Control%20Technology/Dash/Grocery%20Delivery/Dash_FractionGroceryList.pdf" target="_self">Fraction Grocery List</a></li>
<li><strong><a href="../LiftoffChallenges/Robotics%20and%20Control%20Technology/Dash/Grocery%20Delivery/Dash_FractionGroceryCards.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fraction Grocery Cards</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The Fraction Grocery Cards are the items you have available in your grocery store. You decide where you want each item to be located in your grocery store. You can also program Dash to pick up additional groceries and supplies, which you will later draw on your floor plan. You will design a layout of your choice.</p>
<p>The Fraction Grocery List is your checklist to ensure the Dash robot has collected all required grocery items. You will notice the fraction values on the grocery cards are represented differently on the grocery list. You will see fraction values representing whole numbers, fractions with the same numerator, and fractions with the same denominator. You will see fraction values with the greater than or less than symbols.</p>
<p>As Dash navigates the grocery store, compare the fractions on the grocery cards to the fractions on the grocery list. Record your findings. <em>For example, did Dash navigate to a grocery card that is less than 1/2, as shown on the grocery list? If so, what is the item? What fraction is displayed on the grocery card? </em></p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1bg6jemae3"><strong>Organize and Draw Your Floor Plan</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Review your plan and the list of items your robot will collect.</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Print and cut out each of the<strong> <a href="../LiftoffChallenges/Robotics%20and%20Control%20Technology/Dash/Grocery%20Delivery/Dash_FractionGroceryCards.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fraction Grocery Cards</a></strong>.</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Using graph paper or an online grid, create a floor plan of your grocery store. Mark where each grocery or supply is located; this includes items on the grocery cards and any other supplies you think would be important for someone in need.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re not sure how to organize your grocery store, you could do something as simple as this <a href="../LiftoffChallenges/Robotics%20and%20Control%20Technology/Dash/Grocery%20Delivery/Grocery%20Store%20Map%20Example.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grocery Store Map Example</a>.</p>
<p>Or, you could make aisles and have Dash navigate from one aisle to the next.</p>
<p>You could even group like items; the apple and grapes could be set in the same produce section. The yogurt and milk could share a space in the same refrigerator.</p>
<p>Think about what you do on a shopping trip. <em>What else should you mark on your floor plan?</em></p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1bg6jlt4n7"><strong>Draw Your Path</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">On graph paper, draw the path you want Dash to follow.</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Think about the blocks you’ll need to use in the Blockly app to guide Dash. Keep in mind that the farthest distance Dash can drive using one code block may not be far enough for your grocery store. <em>If that’s the case, how could you get Dash to drive farther? </em></li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Create a model of your grocery store on the floor around you. You can create a grid-like sketched map with painter’s tape, a large sheet of paper, or even the floor tiles in your classroom. To make your model more realistic, you may want to mark or place small objects where the grocery items are on your map.</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Place each item from the Fraction Grocery Cards at different locations on your grocery store floor plan. Draw or mark where you plan to include additional supplies.</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Take a picture of your floor plan with the Fraction Grocery Cards for your project submission.</li>
</ol>

<h3><strong>Program, Test, and Debug Dash</strong></h3>
<p>Using the Blockly app, program Dash to navigate the grocery store and pick up all the items.</p>
<p><img src="../LiftoffChallenges/Robotics%20and%20Control%20Technology/Dash/Grocery%20Delivery/Dash_FractionGroceryList_CLS.PNG" alt="Fraction Grocery List" title="Fraction Grocery List" width="231" height="258" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<ol>
<li>Review the Fraction Grocery List document.</li>
<li>Start with the <strong>When</strong> block. It is used to start the sequence. Each time your program Dash, you will begin with a <strong>When</strong> block.</li>
<li>Write your program for Dash to pick up each item based on the Fraction Grocery List, and any additional supplies.</li>
<li>Take a picture of the program.</li>
<li>Run your program and watch Dash navigate to each of the items.</li>
<li>Record the value of each fraction Dash navigates to.</li>
<li>Match your recorded list with the Fraction Grocery List; write the grocery item and value next to the relevant fraction.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now it's time to think about how you can debug and improve your code. <em>Is there an easier way to complete the challenge? Can you use fewer blocks?</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Collect notes and ideas in your journal of the improvements you want to make.</li>
<li>Make the changes to your program.</li>
<li>Test your new code and repeat your program until you’re happy with the final program.</li>
</ol>
