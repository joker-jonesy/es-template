<h3 id="mcetoc_1bg6jemae3">Pick or Write Your Short Story</h3>
<p>You first need to pick the story you want to read or plan to write your own short story. Keep in mind that you are adding sound effects, so you want to make sure your story is one you feel comfortable adding sounds to.</p>
<p>If you are writing a story, be creative with it! You can use the <a href="../LiftoffChallenges/Digital%20Communications/Skoog/Create%20a%20Sound%20Story/Skoog_Create%20a%20Sound%20Story%20Project%20Starter.docx?isCourseFile=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Short Story Planning Template</a> to help you plan. There is even a section to brainstorm your sound effects. After you have planned your story. You can begin writing it. Consider including onomatopoeia words like “buzz, crash, or shh” to easily incorporate sound. You may also consider the details you want to include in your story and how you can use sound alongside them to strengthen your story.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1bg6jemae3">Pick Your Sound Effects</h3>
<p>As you read through your story, decide where you will want to add your sound effects. Use the sound effects section of the template to help you plan. Think about how you can use sound effects throughout your book to convey feelings or emotions. If something surprising happens, you could play a surprised sound effect. If it’s a funny book, you could consider including laughing after a joke. You could even have special sounds for each character such as a lightening bolt for the villain. As stated above, onomatopoeia is a great place for a sound effect. You could also use common sounds you hear everyday like birds chirping, train whistles, cars driving, etc. It just depends on what your story is about. You can also include them to let the readers know what is about to happen or to enhance what is happening. Some examples could be: it’s raining so you include the sound effects of raindrop, there is a knock at the door so you include a knocking sound, a character is happy so you include an upbeat sound, animals are making noises, etc. Just remember, the sounds are being used to enhance the book as you read it. Each place that you are going to include a sound, you should make a note on the template of what sound and where so that you remember.</p>
<p>TIP: If you are choosing a story instead of writing your own, you can use sticky notes to plan your sounds so you don’t write on the pages.</p>

<h3 id="mcetoc_1bg6jlt4n7">Find or Record Your Sound Effects in GarageBand</h3>
<p>After you decide what sound effects you want to include in your story, you will need to find or record them! Sound designers use pre-recorded sounds, but they also record sounds that they make themselves using different objects and themselves. If they wanted to mimic opening a present, they may crinkle paper, for bird wings they may flip pages in a book, they could even make the sound of rain by tapping their fingers on a table. You should also browse the pre-recorded sounds in the sound library to see if there are any of those you want to use. To get to the sound library go to the instruments page and scroll until you see the sound library.</p>

<p>As you are finding and/or recording your sound effects, you may find it useful to try them out on your Skoog. Remember that each side of the Skoog represents a different note and that you can edit the pitch and scale of the Skoog within the app. Try out the different notes, pitches, and scales to see which one works the best. Make sure you write down the side of your Skoog that you use and the scale so that you don’t forget when you are playing them!</p>
<h3>Add Sound Effects without GarageBand</h3>
<p>If you are unable to use GarageBand for your sound effects, you can still use Skoog to play different sounds to make your story more entertaining. However, Skoog does not allow you the option to record sounds or have any pre-recorded sounds to choose from, only instruments. Due to this you may need to adjust your story so that you are only using instrument noises. One idea might be to have specific instruments accompany certain characters or actions, such as, a high pitched Flute note for a good character or a low pitched Moon Synth note if something bad happens. To access these instrument sounds do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the Skoog App.<br><img src="LiftoffChallenges/Digital%20Communications/Skoog/Create%20a%20Sound%20Story/Skoog_SkoogIcon_CLS.png" alt="screenshot of Skoog app" title="screenshot of Skoog app" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%;"><br><br></li>
<li>Click the Guitar icon to pick a new instrument.<br><img src="LiftoffChallenges/Digital%20Communications/Skoog/Create%20a%20Sound%20Story/Skoog_GuitarIcon_CLS.png" alt="screenshot of guitar icon to change instruments" title="screenshot of guitar icon to change instruments" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%;"><br><br></li>
<li>Click the Note icon to change the key, scales, and notes.<br><img src="LiftoffChallenges/Digital%20Communications/Skoog/Create%20a%20Sound%20Story/Skoog_Scales_CLS.png" alt="screenshot of note icon to edit scales and keys" title="screenshot of note icon to edit scales and keys" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%;"><br><br><img src="LiftoffChallenges/Digital%20Communications/Skoog/Create%20a%20Sound%20Story/Skoog_NotesIcon_CLS.png" alt="screenshot of note icon to edit notes" title="screenshot of note icon to edit notes" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%;"></li>
</ol>
<h3>Read Your Story</h3>
<p>Now that you have all of your sound effects saved you can read your story! Record yourself reading your story by using the camera on your ipad. Make sure you play your sound effects using your Skoog. Save your recording to upload in your project submission.&nbsp;</p>
