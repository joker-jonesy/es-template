<p>Your challenge is to learn more about the air around you. You and a partner will list what you already know and want to know about air. You will learn more about air, including the molecules that make up air. Then you will add and subtract fractions with common denominators to understand how atoms make up a molecule. Finally, you will create a presentation to show what you know, want to know, and have learned about air.</p>

<h3><strong>What Do You Know About the Air We Breathe?</strong></h3>
<p>Talk with your partner about air. <em>What do you already know about air?</em> Here are some facts you can use as starting points:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Air protects Earth in the form of the atmosphere.</li>
<li>The atmosphere is made up of several gases, both healthy and unhealthy.</li>
<li>Gases are made up of molecules.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Which of these facts are already familiar? What details can you add to show your understanding?</em> Make a “K” list showing all of the facts you <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>K</strong></span>now. Be sure to include the details of what you already know about these facts.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1bg6jemae3"><strong>Questions About the Air We Breathe</strong></h3>
<p><em>Of the facts listed above, which ones were new to you?</em> Perhaps they sparked questions. <em>What questions come to mind? What else do you want to know about air?</em></p>
<p>With your partner, think of at least three questions you can ask about air. Now create a “W” list,&nbsp; identifying your questions, what you <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>W</strong></span>ant to learn.</p>
<p>You will use these questions to help guide your learning.</p>

<h3><strong>Adding and Subtracting Air Molecules</strong></h3>
<p>Air is made up of different types of <strong>molecules</strong>. Two of the molecules mentioned in the poem are oxygen and ozone. Oxygen is made up of two oxygen <strong>atoms</strong>. One atom of oxygen makes up ½ of the molecule. <em>How can you show that by adding a second oxygen atom, you would get one whole molecule of oxygen?</em></p>
<p>To prove that two halves make a whole, you can add the fractional parts together.</p>
<p>Since both fractional parts have a <strong>common denominator</strong>, we can add the numerators and place the sum over the like denominator.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 19px;">1/2 + 1/2 = 2/2</span></p>
<span style="font-size: 19px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2/2 = 1</span>
<p>An ozone molecule has three oxygen atoms. One oxygen atom is&nbsp;⅓ of a molecule of ozone.</p>
<p><em>What part of an ozone molecule is 3 oxygen atoms? Support your answer by showing your math work.</em></p>
<p>We can also subtract fractions with like denominators by simply adding the numerators and placing the difference over the like denominator.</p>
<p><em>If we take away one oxygen atom from an ozone molecule, what part of the ozone molecule remains?</em></p>
<p>One of Earth’s neighboring planets is Mercury. Nitrogen and Oxygen can also be found in Mercury’s atmosphere, but almost 95% of Mercury’s atmosphere is Carbon Dioxide, which is made up of one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms.</p>
<p><em>If carbon makes up&nbsp;⅓ of a molecule of carbon dioxide, how can you use a fraction to represent the oxygen part of the molecule?</em></p>
<p><em>How can you use math to show that the carbon atom and the two oxygen atoms make up one whole molecule of carbon dioxide?</em></p>
<p>Be sure to write down the answers to these math questions so you can include them in your presentation later.</p>
<h3><strong>What Did You Learn About Air?</strong></h3>
<p><em>Did you find answers to your questions about air in the poem?</em> You can also do research on the internet if you have some questions left unanswered.</p>
<p>Finish your presentation by creating an “L” list showing what you <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>L</strong></span>earned.</p>
<ol>
<li>Write down any answers you found to your questions.</li>
<li>Find images on the internet or take screenshots of the poem to accompany the facts you are including in your presentation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Use both words and pictures to show what you have learned about air.</p>
