<p>Your challenge is to learn how to control a character in a computer game. Your challenge is to use Python Script coding language to program your hero in Code Combat to defeat evil and collect gems. As your hero moves through each of the levels you will interpret division of unit fractions by whole numbers and whole numbers by unit fractions, and then you will compute the quotients.</p>
<p><strong>**The first 21 levels in the Kithgard Dungeon are free to all users, but any levels beyond the first must be purchased. You can move into the Forest and complete free levels in that world. If you would like to access more levels and learn more coding skills, ask your facilitator to purchase a premium class subscription on the CodeCombat website!</strong></p>

<h3><strong>Get Into Combat!</strong></h3>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-8">
<p>Log onto&nbsp;<a href="https://codecombat.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Code Combat</a> and click the Try the Game button to get started.</p>
<p>You will start in the first world called Kithgard Dungeon where you will work through challenges using Python.</p>
<p>When you open the first checkpoint, Dungeons of Kithgard, you will need to choose your hero and pick the Python programming language in the box at the bottom of the screen. You must move through the checkpoints in the correct order as you build on your skills.</p>

<p>In the Career Connection section, you already explored some specific ways that division with fractions and whole numbers might occur in a computer game. Now, as you play Cod eCombat, consider whether these ways apply to your game experience or if there are other ways that division is involved.</p>
<p></p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1bg6jemae3"><strong>Level One</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p>On level 1, when the hero moves to the right one space using the code "hero.moveRight(1)," it takes the hero 10 steps. <em>What unit fraction could you write to represent the fraction of the move represented by each step? How many dots on the gameboard does each move of 1 space cover?</em> Complete the following equation:</p>
<p>1 space ______ (unit fraction) = ________ dots</p>
<p><em>How could we reverse this concept?</em> Complete the following equation:</p>
<p>____ dots ______ (unit fraction) = ________ space</p>
<p><em>How would you find the fraction of the move represented by 5 dots?</em> Complete the following equation:</p>
<p>5 dots ______ (unit fraction) = _____ space (this should be a fraction!)</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1bg6jemae3"><strong>Level Two</strong></h3>
<p>On level 2, you will see that the hero walks back and forth on the same path. <em>What fraction of the whole path does each dot on the gameboard represent? How many dots make up the entire path? How many dots make up half of the path?</em> After finding these numbers, complete the equation below.</p>
<p>½&nbsp;path÷ ______ dots = ________ fraction of whole path for each dot</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1bg6jemae3"><strong>Level Three</strong></h3>
<p><em>What fractions do you see in level 3?</em> Look at how the hero moves. <em>How can you write a fraction that shows his movement? How many dots make up the path?</em> Create an equation using the format from levels 1 and 2.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1bg6jemae3"><strong>Build on Your Skills</strong></h3>
<p>Move through the different levels as you practice the different commands. You will start with basic commands and work your way to more complicated code like loops and variables. You are able to move on to the next challenge only when you have successfully completed the current challenge, but you can always go back to practice your skills in an already completed challenge. Sometimes there is more than one way to successfully complete the challenge, so try to write the code in different ways to see if it will work! Get creative!</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1bg6jemae3"><strong>Build on Your Skills</strong><strong></strong></h3>
<p>There are tools inside the checkpoint that can help you as you build on your skills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each time you open a new challenge there is a goal page that pops up and reminds you what you need to do including tips and tricks to solve the challenge.</p>
<p>If you need to change your script language or change something about your hero, click <strong>Game Menu</strong>.</p>
<p>If you need to change your challenge or return to the map, click <strong>Map</strong>.</p>
<p>If you forget the script commands your hero needs to complete the challenge, look at the <strong>Methods</strong> list.</p>
<p>If you need help, click <strong>Hints </strong>for tips and tricks.</p>
