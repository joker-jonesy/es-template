<p>Your challenge is to research a famous tower and recreate it using Goobi building materials. As you plan your tower, you will use division to make sure you have enough pieces. You will also use division to figure out how to build a smaller model of your tower. Finally, you will write word problems to describe your tower. See if your friends can solve them!</p>

<h3><strong>Choose a Tower</strong></h3>
<p>Use the Internet to locate a famous tower. Collect some information on the tower you choose:&nbsp;<strong></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><em>What is the name of your tower?</em></li>
<li><em>When and where was the tower built?</em></li>
<li><em>How long did it take to complete?</em></li>
<li><em>What material is it made out of?</em></li>
<li><em>Do humans occupy the tower? What is the job of the tower?</em></li>
<li><em>What shapes do you notice in the architectural design?</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Write down at least four interesting facts about the tower. You should also choose an image to include in your Project Submission.</p>

<h3 id="mcetoc_1bg6jemae3"><strong>Plan the Tower</strong></h3>
<p>After gathering information about the tower of your choice, make a plan to construct your tower out of Goobi building materials.</p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Pick a base shape. Think about what the blueprint of the building might look like and start with that shape. You can find helpful suggestions on starting your structure in the <a href="../Liftoff%20Challenges/Mechanics%20and%20Structures/Goobi/Towers/Goobi%20Instruction%20Manual.pdf?isCourseFile=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Goobi Instruction Manual</a>.</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Decide how you will incorporate details of the tower you chose. <em>Can you see shapes when you look at a picture of the tower?</em><br>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Using the image you chose for My Portfolio, outline the shapes you see. You can use a graphics tool to do this on the computer, or you can print the image and draw directly on it.</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">If you cannot annotate the image, write down the shapes you see and describe where you see them.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Draw a simple plan for your tower on grid paper. You can also use an online program such as <a href="https://sketch.io/sketchpad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sketchpad</a>.</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><em>How high will you make your tower?</em> List how many pieces of each type you will need.<br>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Hint: If you are planning a tower with identical layers, think about how many pieces are needed for one layer. Then, think about how you would multiply that number to represent the total number of layers your tower will need.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Use division to check if you have enough of each piece. Write these division equations on your grid paper. Here are two examples:<br>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Example 1: “My plan uses triangles. Each triangle uses 3 connectors. <em>How many triangles can I make with 45 connectors?</em>” (Repeat this process for the number of rods in each triangle and number of iron balls). <img src="../Liftoff%20Challenges/Mechanics%20and%20Structures/Goobi/Towers/Goobi_Division45by3_CLS.jpg" alt="45 divided by 3" title="45/3" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%;" width="657" height="315"></li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Example 2: “My plan uses rectangles. Each rectangle uses 4 iron balls. My share of the kit has 30 iron balls. <em>How many rectangles can I make?</em>” <img src="../Liftoff%20Challenges/Mechanics%20and%20Structures/Goobi/Towers/Goobi_34divided4_CLS.PNG" alt="30 divided by 4" title="30 divided by 4" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="154" height="57">&nbsp;</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">This equation does not divide evenly. You can only make 7 rectangles with 2 left over. You could ask your friend for 2 more so you can make 8 rectangles.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><em>Do you have enough pieces?</em> If not, revise your plan.</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><em>What is the greatest number of rectangles you can make with your kit if each rectangle uses 4 rods, 4 iron balls, and 4 connectors?</em>&nbsp; Divide the number of connectors, iron balls, and colorful rods to find out.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1bg6jlt4n7"><strong>Build the Tower</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>Construct the tower.&nbsp;</li>
<li><em>How is it the same as the famous tower you found? How is it different?</em></li>
<li>Describe the tower.
<ol>
<li><em>How high is the tower?</em> Use a yardstick or tape measure to find out.</li>
<li><em>How many floors are there?</em></li>
<li><em>How tall is each floor?</em> Divide the total height by the number of floors to find out.</li>
<li><em>How many rectangles did you make to build it?</em></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Go back to your plan that you drew. <em>Did you make changes as you built the tower?</em> If so, describe the changes.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><img src="../Liftoff%20Challenges/Mechanics%20and%20Structures/Goobi/Towers/tower-plans_goobi.png" alt="tower plans" title="tower plans" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1bg6jlt4n7"><strong>Shrink the Tower</strong></h3>
<p><em>Can you make a miniature version of your model tower?</em> Think like an architect. Architects have to be able to share their ideas so they are often responsible for creating miniature versions or models of their designs; the people paying for the buildings as well as the surrounding community can get an idea of what to expect when they look at the smaller model. <em>Can you make your tower smaller?</em> Use division to figure out the connectors needed for:</p>
<ul>
<li>A tower that is half as tall.</li>
<li>A tower that is one-third as tall.</li>
</ul>
<p>If there is enough time, try building one of these smaller models of your tower!</p>
<p>Now describe your tower with word problems. Share these with a friend to see if they can write and solve the division number sentence. For example, “My tower has 6 floors. I used 54 connectors to build my tower. <em>How many connectors were used for each floor?</em>”</p>
<p>The number sentence for this is 54÷6 = ?</p>
