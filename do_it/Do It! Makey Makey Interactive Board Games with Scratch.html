<p>Your challenge is to design a board game that includes a circuit, and requires the player to add and subtract fractions with unlike denominators in order to make a move on the board. Then, use Makey Makey and Scratch to program sounds or actions that respond to spaces on the board game.</p>

<h3><strong>Plan Out Your Board Game</strong></h3>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-8">
<p>Your first challenge is to brainstorm what your board game will look like. Think about the board games you've played to help you come up with ideas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you talk with your partner, decide on:</p>
<ul>
<li>A theme (like Escape Room, Journey Around the World, Minecraft)</li>
<li><em>What is the goal? Are players trying to get objects, reach the "End," win the most money, defeat an enemy?</em></li>
<li><em>How will players reach the goal?</em></li>
<li><em>What obstacles might stand in the way?</em></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-4">
<figure><img src="../Liftoff%20Challenges/Circuitry/Makey%20Makey/Interactive%20Board%20Games%20with%20Scratch/plan-game_makeymakey.png" alt="game planned on paper" title="game planned on paper" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%;"></figure>
</div>
</div>
<p>To make this a math game, players will need to solve an equation before making a move; they will add or subtract fractions with unlike denominators. One way to do this is to require players to draw and solve an equation card before moving. You will need to write these equations. (Be sure to have the answers written somewhere so the players could check their work).</p>
<p>Create a sketch of your board game and come up with 2-3 events that will happen when players land on the spaces. Pick 5-7 spaces on the board where these events will happen.</p>
<p>These events can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Player moves forward X number of spaces</li>
<li>Player moves backward X number of spaces</li>
<li>Player gets money, tokens, or an object he/she needs to win</li>
<li>Player trades spaces with another player</li>
<li>Player gets "stuck" and can't move until his/her next turn</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1bg6jemae3"><strong>Program Each Event</strong></h3>
<p>Your next challenge is to develop programs for each event. For each space that has a special event, use Scratch block-coding to program a sound or animation to signal that the event has occurred.</p>
<p>Choose an Event Block for each type of event. When you create your board later, you will connect the spaces to the correct sound or animation using Makey Makey.</p>
<p>For example, when an Escape Room player lands on a clue space, an alarm would sound, and then Scratch could play a sound clip that says, "You have found a clue!" When a player lands on a "false" clue space, an alarm would sound, and then Scratch could play a sound clip that says "No clue here! You lose one minute of search time."</p>

<h3 id="mcetoc_1bg6jlt4n7"><strong>Wire Your Board Game</strong></h3>
<p>Your final challenge is to create and wire the board game.</p>
<p>Wire the Path</p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Sketch the path of the spaces on the board game.</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Place copper tape, wire, or tin foil on or underneath the spaces where each event will happen.</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Use copper tape, wire, or tin foil to connect the spaces for each type of event. The game piece will be used to complete the circuit and start the Scratch program for each event. <em>How do you keep the events separate if the wire path crosses? Will you use a series or parallel circuit?</em> Test it out on a blank piece of paper.</li>
</ol>

<p>Test Each Circuit</p>
<ol>
<li>Connect the alligator leads from the Makey Makey Collection to the board game and the circuit board.</li>
<li>Create the game pieces. <em>What materials can you use for the game pieces?</em> Test out a few materials from the Makey Makey Accessory Collection.</li>
<li>Test your board game. <em>How do you connect multiple game pieces? What happens if multiple players land on the same type of space? Do parallel and series circuits change what happens?</em></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="mcetoc_1bg6jlt4n7"><strong>Finish Your Board Game</strong></h3>
<p>Now that your programming and circuit is complete, you can add the finishing touches so it is ready to play. Add illustrations, a title, game pieces for each player to use, and anything else needed for your custom game. When the game is finished, explain the rules to your partner or another group and start playing!</p>
