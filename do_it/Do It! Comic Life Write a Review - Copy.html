<p>Your challenge is to choose an experience that you want to write an overall honest review about. In the review, cover all aspects of the experience you had. Conduct a survey of other people who experienced the same product, restaurant, or event as you. Using Comic Life, turn the review of that experience into a comic.</p>

<h3>Create Your Outline</h3>
<p>Start by creating an outline for your comic. Remember to include the information you brainstormed in the Plan and SMART Goal assignment.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Summarize your experience.</li>
<li><em>How will your review be made into a comic?</em> Sketch a layout of your comic frames.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1bg6jemae3">Create and Conduct Your Survey</h3>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Create your survey.
<ol type="a">
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">On a separate sheet, write out a few questions that you would like to ask others who experienced the same product, restaurant, or event as you.</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Think about your own experience and use that as a way to produce questions.
<ol type="i">
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Example: You think the restaurant had really good appetizers. You want to know if others think the same thing. A question you might ask is, “If you ordered an appetizer, how would you rate the taste?” Then, give a rating scale of 1-5 (5 being the best) and have the survey taker rate the appetizers.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">After thinking and writing down your questions, create your survey. You can create a survey in Word or Google Docs, or you can use a survey program like Google Forms.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Hand out your survey to people who read the same book, went to the same restaurant, etc.</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Once they have completed the surveys, make sure you collect them.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1bg6jlt4n7">Evaluate Your Data</h3>
<ol>
<li>Go through your surveys to gather data. On a separate paper, log your data. After logging your data, you will express the data as fractions.&nbsp;
<ul>
<li><em>How many people were surveyed in all? How will this number be used in your fractions?</em></li>
<li><em>How many people rated the same number?</em></li>
<li><em>How many people would go back? How many wouldn’t?</em></li>
<li>Write the specific feedback people wrote and note any wrote the same thing. For example, you may note that three people mentioned that they got seated at the restaurant immediately.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After answering the questions above, turn each of the numbers into fractions. If you need a reminder on creating a fraction, go up to the <em>What You Should Know</em> section.</li>
</ol>

<p>Using the data from my survey, I combined all of the answers on one page. This makes evaluating data and creating fractions simpler.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1bg6jemae3">Review Your Outline</h3>
<p>Go back to your outline and use your data to make notes of where you want to add that information into your comic.</p>
<p><img src="../Liftoff%20Challenges/Digital%20Communications/Comic%20Life/Write%20a%20Review/ComicLife_ComicExample_CLS.jpg" alt="comic example" title="comic example" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1bg6jemae3">Create Your Comic</h3>
<p>Using your outline, begin to create your comic. To do so:</p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Choose a template or create your own.</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Add panels.</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Add images and drawings.</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Add details with the toolbar.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is important to save your work! Once you finish your comic, click Save one final time. There are a few options to export your comic. Exporting as a PDF or image is simplest to share with others. Once the comic is exported, it saves to your computer. You can then share your comic with everyone! Send it out in an email, post it on a website, or print it out and give it to family and friends.</p>
