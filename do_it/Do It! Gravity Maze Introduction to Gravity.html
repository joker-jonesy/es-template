<p dir="ltr">Your challenge is to solve as many Gravity Maze puzzles as you can by using the force of gravity and tower playing pieces to get a ball to fall from the Start Position to the Target Tower. With each puzzle you attempt, you will collect measurements, which you will use to create diagrams and solve related word problems. See how many Gravity Maze challenges you can solve!<strong></strong></p>

<h3 id="mcetoc_1bg6jemae3">Word Problem Warm-Up</h3>
<p id="mcetoc_1bg6jemae3">Warm up with these word problems. First, draw a picture or number line to show what the problem is asking. Then show your steps, including if you change units of measure. You will submit these as part of your project.</p>
<ol>
<li>One maze has a height of 27 cm. A marble takes 45 seconds to reach the bottom. When the height is changed to 18 cm, the marble takes 24 seconds.

<li>A metal ball and a glass marble went down a maze. The metal ball has a mass of 150 grams. The glass marble has a mass of 5 grams.

<li>A bag of 100 marbles has a mass of 0.75 kilograms. What is the mass of 1 marble?</li>
<li>The same marble went down two different mazes. The time difference between the two mazes was 12 seconds. <em>If the shortest time was 18 seconds, what was the longest time in minutes?</em></li>
<li>A marble run is made of wood and cardboard. The cardboard has a total mass of 125 grams. The total mass of the wood is 6 times as much as the mass of the cardboard. <em>In kilograms, what is the mass of the wood?</em></li>
<li>A metal ball and a glass marble were sent down the same maze. It took both balls 45 seconds to reach the bottom. Explain whether there was a mistake in the time measurements, and how you know.</li>

<h3 id="mcetoc_1bg6jemae3"><strong>How to Play</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li id="mcetoc_1bg6jemae3">Start by choosing two beginner challenge cards. (The cards are numbered 1-60, with 1 being the easiest.) Later you will have a chance to try intermediate, advanced, or expert.</li>
<li>Select one of the two cards to work on first.</li>
<li>You will see the Start Position (represented by a colored tower icon with a white dot inside) and the red Target Tower on the card. You may also see more towers represented on the card. Add the towers you see to your grid. Make sure they are in the right spots and facing the right directions. Dot markings help you figure out which way the towers should face.</li>
<li>Look under<strong> </strong>Add to Grid. This shows you which additional towers you will need to add to your grid to find the solution. Colored squares represent vertical towers. Colored rectangles represent horizontal towers.</li>
<li>The Solution to the card is on the back. But try not to look! Challenge yourself to solve the card on your own.</li>
<li>Once you have solved the challenge, time the ball as it progresses through the maze. <em>How long does it take for the ball to get from the Start Position to the Target Tower in seconds?</em></li>
<li>Measure the height of the tallest tower in centimeters.</li>
<li>Solve the challenge on your second card. Again, time the ball in seconds as it goes from the Start Position to the Target Tower.</li>
<li>Measure the height of the tallest tower in centimeters.</li>
<li>Draw two number lines or diagrams to illustrate the differences between the two mazes, in terms of time and height.</li>
<li>Solve two-word problems related to your challenge. You can either write and solve your own word problems, or fill in the blanks and then calculate the answers to the problems below:
<table border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 99.9393%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="width: 99.8665%;">
<ul>
<li>In Gravity Maze Challenge #___, it took the ball ___ seconds to go from the Start Position to the Target Tower. In Challenge #___, it took the ball ___ seconds. <em>How many more tenths of a second did it take the ball in the slower maze? How many minutes is that?</em><em></em><em></em></li>
<li>Gravity Maze #___ is ____ cm high. Gravity Maze #___ is ___ cm high.<em> How much taller is Gravity Maze #___ in mm? How much taller is it in meters?</em></li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</li>
<li>Complete steps 2-12 again, but this time choose two more difficult cards. They can be harder beginner cards, or you can try intermediate, advanced, or expert level challenges.</li>
<li>Now see how many more challenge cards you can solve!</li>
