<p><em>What are different ways to create circuits with more than one light or power source?</em> Your challenge is to learn about parallel and series circuits as you build and test different types of circuit designs. Then, build circuits to fit specific measures of perimeter and area, and learn how to convert unit measurements for the circuits you build.</p>

<h3>Beware of Short Circuits</h3>
<p>Remember to Avoid Short Circuits! Any electrical path without resistance from a load like a light or motor is a short circuit. Short circuits will DAMAGE your Snap Circuits kit. Be sure to check all possible electrical paths for short circuits BEFORE connecting your circuit to a power source. Review short circuits in the Information about Snap Circuits Electricity section.</p>

<h3 id="mcetoc_1bg6jemae3"><strong>Build a Series Circuit</strong></h3>
<p>Build the circuit shown below. Notice that it uses two lights. Note: Your kit may have two L1 lights OR one L1 and one L2 light.</p>
<p><img src="../Liftoff%20Challenges/Circuitry/Snap%20Circuits%20Electricity/Series%20and%20Parallel%20Circuits/circuit-example-series_snapcircuitselectricity.png" alt="series circuit" title="series circuit" width="449" height="176" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>When two lights are connected in a line one behind the other, it is called a <em><strong>series circuit</strong></em>.</p>
<p>This is like having two cars driving single file in the same lane.</p>
<p><img src="../Liftoff%20Challenges/Circuitry/Snap%20Circuits%20Electricity/Series%20and%20Parallel%20Circuits/series-cars_snapcircuitselectricity.png" alt="two cars driving single file in the same lane" title="two cars driving single file in the same lane" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>Test your series circuit and note the brightness of the bulbs. <em>How does it compare to the circuit with one light?</em></p>
<p>Review the <em>What You Should Know: How Does a Light Bulb Work?</em> section. Find out how electricity runs through a light bulb. The light bulb is actually part of the wiring path. <em>What do you think happens when the filament breaks or we unscrew the bulb?</em></p>
<p><img src="../Liftoff%20Challenges/Circuitry/Snap%20Circuits%20Electricity/Series%20and%20Parallel%20Circuits/disconnected-path_snapcircuitselectricity.png" alt="disconnected path" title="disconnected path" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="207" height="124" style="max-width: 100%; float: right;">While we cannot actually unscrew the bulb in our Snap Circuits kit, we can create the same effect by disconnecting the wiring path right next to one of the bulbs. Observe what happens. <em>Do one or both of the lights go off?</em></p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1bg6jlt4n7"><strong>Build a Parallel Circuit</strong></h3>
<p>Now, build another circuit with two lights, but connect them side-by-side instead of in a line.</p>
<p>Build the circuit shown below. Note: your kit may have two L1 lights OR one L1 and one L2 light.</p>
<p><img src="../Liftoff%20Challenges/Circuitry/Snap%20Circuits%20Electricity/Series%20and%20Parallel%20Circuits/circuit-example-parallel_snapcircuitselectricity.png" alt=" parallel circuit" title=" parallel circuit" width="424" height="190" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>When lights are connected side-by-side(so that they each have their own path) it is called a <strong>parallel circuit</strong>.</p>
<p>This is like having two cars driving side-by-side in their own lanes.</p>
<p><img src="../Liftoff%20Challenges/Circuitry/Snap%20Circuits%20Electricity/Series%20and%20Parallel%20Circuits/parallel-cars_snapcircuitselectricity.png" alt="two cars driving side-by-side in their own lanes" title="two cars driving side-by-side in their own lanes" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>Test your circuit and observe what happens. <em>How does the brightness of the bulbs compare to the series circuit?</em></p>
<img src="../Liftoff%20Challenges/Circuitry/Snap%20Circuits%20Electricity/Series%20and%20Parallel%20Circuits/disconnected-path2_snapcircuitselectricity.png" alt="disconnect one of the wiring connectors " title="disconnect one of the wiring connectors " data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="266" height="122" style="max-width: 100%; float: right;">
<p>Repeat the same experiment you did with the series circuit to see what happens when a bulb is unscrewed or the bulb burns out (i.e. the filament breaks). Disconnect one of the wiring connectors as shown.</p>
<p>Test your circuit and observe what happens: <em>Do one or both lights go out? How does the parallel circuit compare to the series circuit?</em></p>
<p>When a bulb burns out or is unscrewed in a series circuit, the wiring path is broken for the whole circuit. Since there is only one possible path for the electricity, it cannot flow to any bulb in the circuit. None of the bulbs will work.</p>
<p><img src="../Liftoff%20Challenges/Circuitry/Snap%20Circuits%20Electricity/Series%20and%20Parallel%20Circuits/seriesinterrupt_snapcircuitelectricity.png" alt="series circuit with break" title="series circuit with break" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>When a bulb burns out or is unscrewed in a parallel circuit, the wiring path is only interrupted for that part of the circuit.</p>
<p>There is still a possible path for the electricity to flow to other bulbs in the circuit. Only one bulb is affected, so other bulbs will work.</p>
<p><img src="../Liftoff%20Challenges/Circuitry/Snap%20Circuits%20Electricity/Series%20and%20Parallel%20Circuits/parallelinterrupt_snapcircuitselectricity.png" alt="parallel circuit with wiring break" title="parallel circuit with wiring break" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p><em>Did you also notice that the bulbs were brighter in the parallel circuit than in the series circuit?</em></p>
<p>In a series circuit, the voltage from the power supply is shared by all the bulbs in the circuit.</p>
<p>Voltage is one measure of electrical energy.</p>
<p>When two identical bulbs are in a series circuit, they each only get half as much voltage and cannot glow as brightly.</p>
<p><img src="../Liftoff%20Challenges/Circuitry/Snap%20Circuits%20Electricity/Series%20and%20Parallel%20Circuits/voltageall_snapcircuitselectricity.png" alt="voltage is split between all of the bulbs" title="voltage is split between all of the bulbs" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>In a parallel circuit, the voltage from the power supply is not shared by the bulbs in the circuit.</p>
<p>Each bulb in a parallel circuit gets the same amount of voltage as it would if it were the only bulb in the circuit, so they glow just as brightly.</p>
<p><img src="../Liftoff%20Challenges/Circuitry/Snap%20Circuits%20Electricity/Series%20and%20Parallel%20Circuits/voltagenotshared_snapcircuitselectricity.png" alt="voltage not split between all of the bulbs" title="voltage not split between all of the bulbs" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="403" height="181" style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p><em>When does it make sense to use a parallel circuit instead of a series circuit? What kind of circuit do you think is used most often in your house?</em></p>
<h3><strong>Build Your Circuit</strong></h3>
<p>Decide on an invention you want to create. Build the circuit and then determine the area and perimeter required to create a container for it.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Build a Circuit to Fit the Space</strong></h3>
<p><em>Can you help complete the circuits?</em> Take a picture or sketch out your own simplified wiring diagram on a circuit planning grid.</p>
<p><img src="../Liftoff%20Challenges/Circuitry/Snap%20Circuits%20Electricity/Series%20and%20Parallel%20Circuits/SnapCircuits_PlanningGrid_CLS.jpg" alt="planning grid" title="planning grid" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="406" height="271" style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>A parallel circuit needs to be built in the shape of a rectangle with 32 units2. One side, with a length of 4 units, has already been built. Complete the circuit, while making sure that the area inside the circuit is equal to 32 units<sup>2</sup>. <em>What are the lengths of the other three sides? What is the perimeter of your circuit?</em></p>
<p>Assume that the circuit you built is a part of a model for a much larger circuit for an air conditioning unit for a school building.<em> If each unit on the snap grid were equal to 1’ in the real world, what would be the lengths of the sides in feet?&nbsp; What would the lengths of the sides be in inches?</em></p>
<p>Record the measures—in both feet and inches—in a two-column table.</p>
<table border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 96.2312%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="width: 33.2898%;">Measures</td>
<td style="width: 33.2898%;">Feet&nbsp;</td>
<td style="width: 33.2898%;">Inches</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="width: 33.2898%;">Length</td>
<td style="width: 33.2898%;"></td>
<td style="width: 33.2898%;"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="width: 33.2898%;">Width</td>
<td style="width: 33.2898%;"></td>
<td style="width: 33.2898%;"></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p></p>
<p><em>What would be the perimeter of the circuit needed for the air conditioning unit in inches? In feet? When you convert the lengths from feet to inches, why are there more inches than feet?</em></p>
<p>Build a series circuit with a perimeter of 28 units, where one of the sides measures 7 units. <em>If the circuit is to be built in the shape of a rectangle, what would be the lengths of the other three sides?&nbsp; What would be the area of the grid inside of the circuit?</em></p>
<p>To convert from cm to mm, you need to know that 1 cm = 10 mm.<em> If one unit on the snap grid were equal to 1 cm, what would be the length of each side in mm? &nbsp; What would the area of the grid inside of the circuit be in mm<sup>2</sup>?</em></p>
