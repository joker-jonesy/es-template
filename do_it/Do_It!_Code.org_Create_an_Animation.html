<h3>Plan your Animation</h3>
<p>Before coding your program, it is important that you plan. Use the accordion below to help you make sure you have considered your design before you begin coding.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- Accordion headings should be changed to respect page hierarchy --></p>
<p class="instruction">Select each item to learn more.</p>
<p><button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary expandall" aria-expanded="false">Open All Panels</button></p>
<div class="accordion">
<div class="card">
<div class="card-header">
<h2 class="card-title">Color of background</h2>
</div>
<div class="collapse">
<div class="card-body">
<p><em>What color would you like the background to be?</em> Remember that you can use the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">W3 Schools Color Webpage</a>&nbsp;to find a color or you can use the lowercase name of a color.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="card">
<div class="card-header">
<h2 class="card-title">Type of ball to be used</h2>
</div>
<div class="collapse">
<div class="card-body">
<p>Now think of your ball sprite. Decide what type of ball you would like to use in your animation and whether you would like to draw it yourself or use a pre-drawn one. <em>Do you want it to be a baseball? A fuzzy ball? A soccer ball?</em> You may find it helpful to browse through the animation library for ideas.</p>

<div class="card">
<div class="card-header">
<h2 class="card-title">Name of sprite variable</h2>
</div>
<div class="collapse">
<div class="card-body">
<p>Go ahead and decide what you are going to name your sprite variable in your program. A good rule of thumb is to keep it simple with a description such as “bluebaseball” or “basketball” so that you can easily remember it.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="card">
<div class="card-header">
<h2 class="card-title">Velocity of sprite (x,y)</h2>
</div>
<div class="collapse">
<div class="card-body">
<p>Finally, decide the velocity of your sprite. Remember that velocity is the speed at which an object travels in a certain direction. Therefore, the larger your numbers are, the farther the sprite will move along the grid in each frame and the faster it will appear to move. If the sprite is too fast it can make the animation disorienting, but if it is too slow it can be boring.</p>
<p>NOTE: The maximum of both the x and y on the grid is 400, so if either number is larger than that you will not be able to see your sprite moving at all.</p>

</div>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1bg6jemae3">Create a New Project and Background</h3>
<p>Now that you have your animation planned it is time to create it. Make sure that you are using your planning sheet to make things easier. Create a new project in GameLab and rename it. Begin by changing the color of your background. Remember that the function draw { block is an important block for animations, so do not delete it. After you have coded your background to be a different color, run the program to make sure that your code is working so far. If it is not, you need to debug your program to figure out what the problem is.</p>
<h3>Create Your Ball Sprite</h3>
<p>It is now time to start making your ball. Use your planning sheet to help you. You must begin by finding or creating the animation that you would like to use for your ball. You may want to try searching for “ball” in the animation library.</p>
<img src="../LiftoffChallenges/Software%20Engineering/Code.org/Create%20an%20Animation/Code.org_BallSearch_CLS.png" alt="screenshot of search in animation library" title="screenshot of search in animation library" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%;">
<p>After you have done that, you can create your ball sprite in your program. Make sure to “run” your program when you are finished. If you have coded your program correctly to make your ball sprite then it should pop up on your grid. If it does not work or does not look the way that you expected, then you may need to debug your program.</p>
<p>NOTE: Recall that any code within the function draw() { block is continuously being redrawn.</p>
<h3>Make Your Ball Bounce</h3>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-8">
<p>Once your program is coded to display your ball sprite correctly you need to make it bounce. &nbsp;Recall that velocity is the speed of an object in each direction. You need to make sure that your ball has an initial velocity to get it moving. You may find that the velocity you originally planned to use is either too fast or too slow. You can change it as you are coding your program. Once your ball has an initial velocity, it is important that it also has the ability to bounce off the edges of the grid. This ensures that it does not just fly off the grid when it is moving. As you are coding your ball to bounce, run your program to check if it is running correctly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>HINT: Be aware of which blocks are included in the draw function { block and if they need to be moved out of it.&nbsp;</p>
