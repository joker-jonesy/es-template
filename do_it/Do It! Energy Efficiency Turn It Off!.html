<p>Your challenge is to figure out ways to save energy, and to convince yourself and others to do it! First, figure out if there are ways that you can conserve energy. <em>Are you an energy saver or can you improve your habits?</em></p>
<p>Compare your energy usage with your partner and together, come up with a plan for how each of you could save more energy on a daily basis. Use this information to help you build an argument for conserving energy. You will also calculate the average use of energy in your state—daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly—compare this usage to other states, and use this data to support your argument. You will include all of this important information on a poster, brochure, flyer, or in a presentation.</p>

<h3>How Can You Become an Energy Saver?</h3>
<p>Everyday we make decisions that lead to energy conservation or energy use.<em> Should we go to school using a bike, bus, or car? Do we turn the TV off when we aren’t watching it, or do we keep it on as background noise? </em>Consider what you do during the average day. Think about how you spend your time and what electronic devices and appliances you are using. To get an idea of your energy usage, take this <a href="../Express%20Challenges/Sustainability/Energy%20Efficiency/EnergyEfficiency_Survey.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Energy Saver Survey.</a>&nbsp;You will submit this survey as part of your project submission.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you have taken the survey, reflect on your responses. Be proud of the ways in which you conserve energy, and consider ways in which you can improve your energy consumption. Start to think about how your answers and realizations could help convince others to save energy. You will include these ideas in your poster, flyer, or presentation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reflection Questions:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>What did you learn from the Energy Saver Survey?</em></li>
<li><em>Do you use a lot of energy or a little?</em></li>
<li><em>What do you do that uses less energy?</em></li>
<li><em>What do you do that uses more energy than is necessary?</em></li>
<li><em>What changes can you reasonably make to use less energy?</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Choose 1-3 areas in which you can improve your energy usage. Write these down and commit to change. <em>Can you start shutting off lights and devices when you are done using them? Can you air dry or towel dry your washed dishes instead of using the dishwasher? Can you combine your laundry with other family members so that you are always washing full loads?&nbsp;</em></p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1bg6jemae3">How Much Energy Do Your Appliances Use?</h3>
<p>All electronic appliances use energy, but some use more than others. Believe it or not, a toaster uses way more energy than a refrigerator: it takes 1200 watts to operate a toaster whereas a freezer uses 180 watts! However, a fridge is on 24 hours a day whereas you may use your toaster for 10 minutes. Rather than trying to save energy by toasting fewer bagels, you can make other small changes that have a big impact, like slightly turning up the temperature of your fridge so it does not have to use quite as much energy to keep itself cold 24 hours a day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To get a better idea of your own energy usage, use this Energy Use Calculator.</p>
<p>You will calculate your energy use of a few key appliances and compare your usage to your partner.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Start by exploring. Simply click on some of the appliances you have in your home. Scan the information to find out how much energy they use and to learn more details about what increases or decreases their energy use. <em>Can you find clues in the articles about how you can use some of these devices more efficiently and with less energy?</em></li>
<li>Write down all of the appliances from the list that you have in your home. Make a note if you have more than one of any of them.</li>
<li>Choose at least six of the appliances or devices pictured.&nbsp;
<ol>
<li>Pick ones you use regularly and be prepared to do some calculations on paper.&nbsp;</li>
<li>It also helps if you and your partner choose at least 2-4 similar appliances so you can compare your results. (For example, you may use LED light bulbs at home and your partner uses CFL light bulbs. Since both are light bulbs, these can be compared even though they are different types of bulbs. One of you may have a laptop and the other uses a desktop computer with an LCD screen. Or one of you may have a central air conditioner and the other has a window air conditioner unit. These can also be compared.)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Click on the picture to find out how many watts the appliance uses.&nbsp;</li>
<li>If you know how many hours a day you use the appliance, type this into the text field that says “Hours Used Per Day”. If not, you can use the default settings.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Plug the numbers into the equation below to solve for the appliance’s daily energy usage measured in kilowatt hours. Be sure to show your work and round to the nearest hundredth. <math title="" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><semantics><mstyle><mo>&nbsp;</mo><mo>(</mo><mi>w</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>g</mi><mi>e</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>&nbsp;</mo><mo>&nbsp;</mo><mo>(</mo><mi>h</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>u</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>s</mi><mo>&nbsp;</mo><mi>u</mi><mi>s</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>d</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>&nbsp;</mo><mo>&nbsp;</mo><mn>1000</mn><mo>&nbsp;</mo><mo>=</mo><mo>&nbsp;</mo><mi>k</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>l</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>w</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>t</mi><mo>&nbsp;</mo><mi>h</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>u</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>s</mi><mo>&nbsp;</mo><mo>(</mo><mi>k</mi><mi>W</mi><mi>h</mi><mo>)</mo></mstyle><annotation encoding="wiris">{"version":"1.1","math":"&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mo&gt;&amp;#xA0;&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mo&gt;(&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;w&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;a&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;t&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;t&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;a&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;g&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;e&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;)&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mo&gt;&amp;#xA0;&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mo&gt;&amp;#xA0;&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mo&gt;(&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;h&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;o&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;u&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;r&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;s&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;&amp;#xA0;&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;u&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;s&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;e&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;d&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;)&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mo&gt;&amp;#xA0;&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mo&gt;&amp;#xA0;&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mn&gt;1000&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mo&gt;&amp;#xA0;&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mo&gt;=&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mo&gt;&amp;#xA0;&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;k&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;i&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;l&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;o&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;w&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;a&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;t&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;t&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;&amp;#xA0;&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;h&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;o&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;u&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;r&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;s&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;&amp;#xA0;&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mo&gt;(&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;k&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;W&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;h&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;)&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;/math&gt;"}</annotation></semantics></math></li>
<li>Hit “Calculate” to confirm that you got the correct answer.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Hit the back arrow to return to the <a href="https://energyusecalculator.com/calculate_electrical_usage.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Energy Use Calculator</a>&nbsp;landing page and follow these steps for more appliances.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Using the comparison symbols &gt;, =, and &lt;, choose two of your appliances and compare the kilowatt hours per day. Record these comparisons and why you chose to compare the two chosen items. <em><em>Are they two items that seem like they should use the same amount of energy? Are they about the same size, do you use them for similar purposes, or do you use them for about the same amount of time? &nbsp;</em></em>
<p style="text-align: left;"></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Example:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">LCD screen (30 watts) (5 hours) 1000 = 0.15 (kWh)&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">CRT monitor (75 watts) (5 hours) 1000 = 0.38 (kWh)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">0.15&lt;0.38</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I compared the LCD screen to the CRT monitor because my family uses them for about the same amount of time and they are both for watching TV.</p>
</li>
<li>Now focus on the chosen appliances that you and your partner have in common.&nbsp;
<ol>
<li>Using comparison symbols, compare your results with the results of your partner.</li>
<li><em>Whose computer, TV, video game console, or other appliance uses more energy and why?&nbsp;</em></li>
<li><em>What can each of you do to reduce the energy consumed by these devices?</em></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="mcetoc_1bg6jlt4n7">How Does Your State Compare in Energy Usage?</h3>
<p>You should now have an idea of whether you are an energy saver, an energy consumer, or whether you are energy efficient. You should also recognize how much energy some of your appliances use on a daily basis. Now it is time to understand how you and other families in your state compare to average households in other states.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="../Express%20Challenges/Sustainability/Energy%20Efficiency/Turn%20It%20Off/EnergyEfficiency_StateCompMath%20(1).jpg" alt="example calculations for finding and comparing the average energy usage of households in different states" title="example calculations for finding and comparing the average energy usage of households in different states" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%;"></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Look for your state’s average monthly energy usage in this article, <a href="../Express%20Challenges/Sustainability/Energy%20Efficiency/Turn%20It%20Off/EnergyEfficiency_StateEnergyUsage.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Article: How Much Electricity on Average Do Homes in Your State Use?&nbsp;</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Record this value and then use it to figure out the daily, weekly, and yearly energy use for the average household in your state. Round these values to the nearest thousandth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider where your state lies in the list of states. <em>Is it one of the higher energy-use states? Is it one of the states that averages lower on the list? What do you think contributes to its comparatively high, low, or average energy use?&nbsp;</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose another state that interests you.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write down the average monthly energy use for this state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Calculate the daily, weekly, and yearly energy usage for the chosen state and round to the nearest thousandth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use comparison symbols &gt;, =, and &lt; to compare your state’s daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly usage to the average usage of the other state.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reflect on the reasons why your state’s energy usage is less than, greater than, or equal to the usage of the other state. Write down your theories and reasoning.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select another state and follow steps 5-8.</p>
</li>
