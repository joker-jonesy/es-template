<h1>Do It! Vernier Science:&nbsp;Cup Design Time Challenge</h1>

<p dir="ltr">Not all cups are alike, and the materials they are made of can determine how well they move heat into or out of your drink. One cup holding hot chocolate could burn your hands and another may barely warm them.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Your challenge is to design, build, and test the best insulated cup. Then, determine how long the insulated cup keeps water warm.</p>

<h3><strong>Using the Go!Temp Sensor</strong><strong></strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">The experiments in this lesson use the Vernier Go!Temp sensor. The Go!Temp sensor is an electronic temperature sensor that plugs into your computer. If you have not used this sensor before, it is best to practice with the Learning To Use Go!Temp activity.<strong></strong></p>

<h3>The Best Cup Design Challenge<strong></strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><em>Do you think you can design the best insulated cup?</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">You will start with a simple plastic cup and add insulation; you can use materials in the SmartLab or bring supplies from home.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Start by thinking about insulated cups that you have seen and used. <em>What were they made of? What features do they have in common?&nbsp;</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Consider what made them practical insulators. Maybe they fit comfortably in your hand, were lightweight, or inexpensive. An insulated cup is not very useful if it is too heavy to hold or too bulky to carry around.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Think about what you may already know about insulation in general. What could be good materials for you to use in your design? Metals? Plastics? Fabrics? Consider your past experience with certain cups, clothing, carpets, and other common insulators.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Begin creating a presentation for your project. You could use PowerPoint, Google Slides, or another method of presentation. Write a list summarizing your ideas about what makes a good insulating cup.</p>
<strong></strong>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1bg6jemae3"><strong>Cup With No Insulation</strong><strong></strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">See how well a thin plastic cup of hot water holds its heat without any added insulation. In science, we call this test a control. You can compare this data to your own cup design later to see how much of a difference the insulation made.</p>
<ol>
<li role="presentation" dir="ltr">Fill your cup with the hottest water you can get from the faucet.</li>
<li role="presentation" dir="ltr">Connect the Go!Temp temperature sensor to your computer; launch Logger Lite.</li>
<li role="presentation" dir="ltr">Once in Logger Lite, open activity <strong>#13 Design Your Own Thermos</strong>.</li>
<li role="presentation" dir="ltr">Allow the Go!Temp temperature reading to reach the starting temperature of the water. When the reading stops increasing, begin recording temperature data for 20 minutes.</li>
<li role="presentation" dir="ltr">Subtract the final temperature from the starting temperature to calculate the heat loss.</li>
<li role="presentation" dir="ltr">Click “Store” and label this graph “Control Run.”</li>
<li role="presentation" dir="ltr">Click “Save As” under the File menu; name the file “Best Cup” and save it to your student folder.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1bg6jlt4n7">Best Cup Design<strong></strong></h3>
<p>Now you will design your "best cup" using different insulation materials. You can start with a drawing or begin to experiment with different designs and materials. Use materials you have in the SmartLab or ones you brought from home. Take photographs or scans of your design in progress. In your presentation, include these pictures along with design notes and observations. Do not forget that you are designing a cup; there has to be a way to drink out of it.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Best Cup Challenge</strong></h3>
<p>Now that you have designed your best cup, let’s see exactly what your cup can do. <em>How long does it take before hot water cools off in your cup?</em> <em>How long does it take before cold water becomes warm in your cup?</em> These are important real-world questions. No one wants to purchase a cup of hot chocolate that becomes “cold” chocolate before you have a chance to drink it all. Let’s see how long your cup can do its job!</p>
<ol>
<li role="presentation" dir="ltr">Open the <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FPFFxnrtFI7D_jfwzNJboWT3BjAmkCLYi4KYDJ4dryY/copy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elapsed Time T-Chart</a>. You can also make a number line to find the elapsed time.&nbsp;</li>
<li role="presentation" dir="ltr">Connect the Go!Temp temperature sensor to your computer and launch Logger Lite.</li>
<li role="presentation" dir="ltr">Open the “Best Cup” Logger Lite file you created with your control run.</li>
<li role="presentation" dir="ltr">Use the Predict Tool to make a prediction about how your cup design will compare to the control run.</li>
<li role="presentation" dir="ltr">Fill your “best cup” with the hottest water you can get from the faucet.</li>
<li role="presentation" dir="ltr">Record the start time in the table.</li>
<li role="presentation" dir="ltr">Allow the Go!Temp temperature reading to reach the starting temperature of the water.&nbsp;</li>
<li role="presentation" dir="ltr">When the reading stops increasing, do the following: Begin recording temperature data for 20 minutes. Record the temperature and the start time in the t-chart</li>
<li role="presentation" dir="ltr">Check the temperature every 5 minutes or so. Record the temperature and time every time you check.&nbsp;</li>
<li role="presentation" dir="ltr">Stop recording in the table when the temperature is the same three times in a row. This probably means that the water has reached room temperature and will remain at this temperature unless something changes.</li>
<li role="presentation" dir="ltr">Add up all of the hours and minutes in the hours/minutes column. The total is the elapsed time.</li>
<li role="presentation" dir="ltr">Complete the fill-in-the blank at the bottom of the t-chart.</li>
<li role="presentation" dir="ltr">Subtract the final temperature from the starting temperature to calculate the heat loss.</li>
</ol>
<p>See the example of a completed template blow. You will upload a copy of you elapsed time chart in your project submission.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Compare Results</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><em>How did your cup design do?</em> Include a picture of your “best cup" in your presentation. Label the parts and materials and describe how your design is meant to work. Include your experimental results in your presentation and discuss your observations. Include screenshots of the t-chart and Logger Lite, along with labels and an analysis of your findings.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="Liftoff%20Challenges/Scientific%20Data%20and%20Analysis/Vernier/Best%20Cup%20Design/3graph_vernier.png" alt="compare the results in a graph" title="compare the results in a graph" width="369" height="241" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p dir="ltr">Answer these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>How do you think your cup performed?&nbsp;</em></li>
<li><em>How did it perform compared to the control run?</em></li>
<li><em>How did it perform compared to your prediction?&nbsp;</em></li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Share your results with your classmates. If you have time, try to improve your design and get better results.</p>
