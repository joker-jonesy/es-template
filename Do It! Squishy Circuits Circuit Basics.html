<p>Your challenge is to build working circuits using an LED and the Squishy Circuits kit. Then, build a light fixture with a rectangular base in order to house your circuit. Finally, calculate the area of the rectangular base.</p>

<h3><strong>Complete the Circuit</strong></h3>
<p>Your first challenge is to complete a basic circuit using the power pack, colored conductive dough, and an LED light.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Roll two balls of conductive dough.</li>
<li>Connect the red cord from the power pack to one ball of dough and the black cord from the power pack to the other ball of dough.</li>
<li>Separate the metal probes on the LED and stick one into each of the balls of conductive dough.</li>
<li>Turn the switch on the power pack on. You can use the slide switch to increase and decrease the flow of electricity. <em>Did the LED light up?</em></li>
<li>If your LED did not light up try switching the probes. The long side of the metal probe must connect to the positive side of the battery.</li>
<li>Take a photo of your working circuit.&nbsp; Label each part of the circuit.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="mcetoc_1bg6jemae3"><strong>Experiment with Insulators</strong></h3>
<p>Your second challenge is to add an insulator to your circuit. Remember an insulator is not a good conductor of electricity. <em>What do you need to do to complete the circuit with an insulator?</em></p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Roll two balls of colored conductive dough.</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Connect the red cord from the power pack to one ball of conductive dough and the black cord from the power pack to the other ball of conductive dough.</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Place a ball of insulating white clay between the two balls of conductive dough.</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Decide where to put the LED probes. <em>Should the probes be placed in the white insulating dough, in one colored conductive dough balls, or in both colored conductive dough balls?</em></li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Turn the switch on the power pack to the "on" position. You can use the slide switch to increase and decrease the flow of electricity. <em>Did the LED light up?</em></li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">If your LED did not light up, turn off the battery pack and try moving the probes. <em>What do you already know that can help you figure out where to put the metal probes of the LED?</em></li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Take a photo of your working circuit. Label each part of the circuit.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="mcetoc_1bg6jlt4n7"><strong>Design and Build a Light Fixture</strong></h3>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-8">
<p>Now that you have made a working light by completing the circuit, you need a place to put it. Consider light sources in your home. <em>Can you see all of the wires that bring electricity to and from the light bulbs?</em> Other than a cord leading to an outlet, chances are that you can’t. Most designers of lamps and light fixtures try to hide the wires, batteries and other parts that make the lights work.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-4">
<figure><img src="Liftoff%20Challenges/Circuitry/Squishy%20Circuits/Circuit%20Basics/SquishyCircuits_LightFixture_CLS%20(1).jpg" alt="Toddler Night Light - Example Squishy Circuits light fixture with a rectangular base" title="Toddler Night Light - Example Squishy Circuits light fixture with a rectangular base" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%;"></figure>
</div>
</div>
<p>With that in mind, your next challenge is to think like a lighting designer. You will design a light fixture to house your light circuit. You can build the fixture with cardboard or other building materials. The only requirement is that it has a rectangular base that can later be measured for area. (If you have a creative idea that does not involve a rectangular base but has a rectangle in its design, get approval from your Facilitator to build it and measure the area of that rectangle instead.) It’s best if you sketch your ideas on paper before building. You also may want to do a web search for lighting fixtures online to get some creative ideas.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1bg6jemae3"><strong>Calculate the Area of the Base</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>Now it is time to find the area of the rectangular base.
<ol>
<li>Measure the length and width of the base in inches.</li>
<li>Multiply the length times the width to get the area.</li>
<li>Write down the area including the unit. Area is always calculated by using square units.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Take a photo of your light fixture with the LED circuit inside. Label each side of the rectangular base with the length, and show how you calculated the area.</li>
</ol>
