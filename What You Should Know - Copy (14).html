<h1>What You Should Know</h1>
<h2>What is Electricity?</h2>
<p><img src="Liftoff%20Challenges/Circuitry/Squishy%20Circuits/Circuit%20Basics/electricity_squishycircuits.png" alt="electricity lines" title="electricity lines" style="max-width: 100%; float: right;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="462" height="231" /><span style="color: #333333;">Electricity is a type of energy that builds in one place and can flow to another place. The electricity that builds in one place is called&nbsp;<strong>static electricity</strong>, you may have experienced this type of electricity when you walk across a carpet and then get a sharp shock when you touch a doorknob. When you walk across certain kinds of carpet your body builds up an electrical charge, and when you touch something metal, you give that built-up electricity a place to go. You feel a shock as the electricity&nbsp;flows towards the metal.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The electricity&nbsp;that flows from one place to another is called&nbsp;<strong>current electricity&nbsp;</strong>or<strong>&nbsp;electrical current.&nbsp;</strong>We use electrical current to power our appliances including dishwashers, telephones, and flashlights.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1cr5k5ui92u">Closed Circuit&nbsp;</h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">In order for an electrical&nbsp;current to flow, there must be a closed circuit. A&nbsp;<strong>closed&nbsp;circuit</strong>&nbsp;is a closed path or loop where electrical current can flow. If there is a break anywhere in the path or loop the electricity&nbsp;cannot flow and it is called an&nbsp;<strong>open circuit</strong>. An electrical path can accidentally&nbsp;be broken or you can use a&nbsp;<strong>switch</strong>&nbsp;to control the flow of electricity; therefore, an on-off switch is sometimes called a&nbsp;<strong>circuit breaker</strong>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><img src="Liftoff%20Challenges/Circuitry/Squishy%20Circuits/Circuit%20Basics/closed-circuit_squishycircuits.png" alt="example of a closed and an open circuit " title="example of a closed and an open circuit " style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" /></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">A circuit does not have to have wires. All you need for an electric circuit is a power source and conductive&nbsp;material making a path to and from a resistor. The Squishy Circuits kit can be built to work as a closed circuit. The positive and negative terminals for the battery are the red and black wires. They connect to the conductive dough which allows electricity to flow through the LED light, lighting it up.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><img src="Liftoff%20Challenges/Circuitry/Squishy%20Circuits/Circuit%20Basics/complete_squishycircuits.png" alt="parts of a complete circuit" title="parts of a complete circuit" style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" /></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1cr05lgf4r">Short Circuit</h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">A<strong>&nbsp;short circuit</strong>&nbsp;occurs when the electrical current does not follow the correct path or circuit. In a normal circuit, there is a power source and wires connecting to a motor or light. The motor or light is called a&nbsp;<strong>resistor</strong>&nbsp;and when electricity flows through it, some of it is used up making the buzzer beep or the light glow. Without a resistor, the electricity takes a shortcut and builds up in the wires, this can become very dangerous. In a&nbsp;short circuit, wires can heat up enough to cause a&nbsp;fire or explosion.&nbsp;If you pushed the conductive dough balls to touch in the circuit, the electricity flowing through would skip the LED light and cause a short circuit because the resistor has been left out of the circuit.&nbsp; A short circuit could also happen if you touched the positive and negative battery terminals together.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><img src="Liftoff%20Challenges/Circuitry/Squishy%20Circuits/Circuit%20Basics/short-circuit1_squishycircuits.png" alt="short circuit" title="short circuit" style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" /></p>
<h2>Light Emitting Diodes</h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Light Emitting Diodes&nbsp;</strong>or<strong>&nbsp;LEDs</strong>&nbsp;are light bulbs that use less energy to work and give off less heat compared to traditional light bulbs, making them safer and more energy efficient. LEDs&nbsp;can be used anywhere a traditional light bulb is used. LEDs have a positive and negative probe and work when an electrical current is passed through them and excites the material inside.&nbsp;<strong>Be gentle when you move the probe. The metal is flexible but can easily break if bent too far.&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><img src="Liftoff%20Challenges/Circuitry/Squishy%20Circuits/Circuit%20Basics/LED_squishycircuits.png" alt="parts on an LED" title="parts on an LED" style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="585" height="450" /></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">When using the LED in a circuit&nbsp;as a resistor, the positive probe (longer) must be touching the positive (red) battery terminal and the negative (shorter) probe must be touching the negative (black) battery terminal. If your LED does not light up try switching the placement of the probes or check for broken probes.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">*If you run out of LEDs&nbsp;with useable&nbsp;probes, your facilitator can order more LEDs&nbsp;online or through Creative Learning Systems.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1cr5k5ui92v">Conductors and Insulators</h2>
<p><img src="Liftoff%20Challenges/Circuitry/Squishy%20Circuits/Circuit%20Basics/parts_squishycircuits.png" alt="insulator and conductor " title="insulator and conductor " style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" /><span style="color: #333333;">Materials such as copper metal wire conduct electricity or allow it to flow freely. Materials that allow&nbsp;electricity to flow freely through them are called&nbsp;<strong>conductors</strong>. Materials like rubber and plastic that do not allow&nbsp;electricity to flow through them easily are called&nbsp;<strong>insulators.&nbsp;</strong>Conductors and insulators help us control electricity.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Squishy Circuits does not use wrapped wires for conductors and insulators to help the current travel in the circuit. Instead, special dough is used. Inside the Squishy Circuits kit, there are two types of dough. The colored dough is conductive. It is made with salt which has ions and allows for the electrical current to travel easily. The white dough contains sugar instead of salt and does not have ions, so electricity does not travel easily through it. Clay can also be used as an insulator because the materials in clay do not have many ions making it difficult for electricity to travel through it. &nbsp;</span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1cr5k5ui931">Storage and Cleaning</h2>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1cr7u9ct72j"><span style="color: #333333;">Dough Storage&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><em><img src="Liftoff%20Challenges/Circuitry/Squishy%20Circuits/Circuit%20Basics/dough-storage_squishycircuits.png" alt="dough storage " title="dough storage " style="max-width: 100%; float: right;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="253" height="172" />Does your dough seem dry, crumbly, or hard?&nbsp;</em>It is recommended that you store your conductive and insulating dough in a plastic bag to keep it moist for as long as possible. If you notice your dough is starting to dry up, here are some suggestions that could help:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Make sure to always to close your dough container after use and store your dough in a sealed plastic bag. If the dough is starting to get dry, try adding a few drops of water or wrapping the dough in a wet paper towel overnight.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">You can make your own</span> <a rel="noopener" href="Liftoff%20Challenges/Circuitry/Squishy%20Circuits/Circuit%20Basics/Making-Conductive-Dough.pdf" target="_blank">conductive dough</a> <span style="color: #333333;">and</span> <a rel="noopener" href="Liftoff%20Challenges/Circuitry/Squishy%20Circuits/Circuit%20Basics/Making-Insulating-Dough.pdf" target="_blank">insulating dough</a> <span style="color: #333333;">following these recipes.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">You can purchase play-doh and clay products in place of the Squishy Circuits conductive and insulating dough.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1cr7u9ct72k"><span style="color: #333333;">Battery Safety</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">After using the Squishy Circuit power pack you should always make sure it is turned off and the batteries are removed before storing it. This&nbsp;will help the batteries last longer and prevent a short from happening if the metal battery terminals touch.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1cr7u9ct72l"><span style="color: #333333;">Cleaning</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The salt from the conductive dough will affect the metal on the battery terminal and on the LED probes. The salt is&nbsp;<strong>corrosive</strong>&nbsp;which means it eats away at the metal coating. Your Squishy Circuits will last longer and operate better if you gently wipe the probes off with a wet paper towel before putting them away. The probes on the LEDs&nbsp;are very fragile so try not to bend them back and forth when you are cleaning them.&nbsp;</span></p>
