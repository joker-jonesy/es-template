<p>Imagine playing on the slide at your favorite park. <em>What causes you to move down the slide? Do you know what causes you to slow down?</em></p>
<p>Think of a marble run in the same way that you would think of a slide at the park. Instead of you speeding down the slide, there is a marble doing that instead. <em>Did you know that a slide is a type of simple machine and that there are forces acting on an object moving up or down a slide?</em></p>

<p>Think about what those forces may be and how they affect the motion of an object on a slide.</p>

<p><strong>Forces</strong> are all around us and they are needed for almost everything. Whether it is pushing, pulling, lifting, throwing a ball, running, or simply standing, forces are in action.</p>
<ul>
<li>A force is a push or pull.</li>
<li>Forces cause changes in an object’s motion and direction.</li>
<li>An object slows down, stops, speeds up, or changes direction based on the size and direction of the force acting on it.</li>
</ul>
<p>When a cat pushes a ball of yarn with its paw, the yarn will roll across the floor. Force is applied by the cat’s paw to make the yarn move forward.</p>

<h3>Balanced and Unbalanced Forces</h3>
<p>All forces must have a size and direction. The size and direction of the forces acting on an object determine if the forces are balanced or unbalanced. Balanced forces do not cause changes in an object’s motion. The object stays still because the forces acting on an object are the same strength and opposite direction.</p>
<p><img src="Liftoff%20Challenges/Mechanics%20and%20Structures/Lux%20Blox/Marble%20Run/blanced_luxblox.png" alt="balanced force" title="balanced force" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%;"></p>
<p>Unbalanced forces do cause changes in an object’s motion. This happens when an object at rest and a stronger force pushes or pulls the object. The unbalanced force also changes the speed and direction of objects in motion or at rest.</p>

<p>The force that attracts objects with mass toward one another is called <strong>gravity</strong>. In other words, gravity draws things toward one another. Gravity is the force that keeps your feet on the ground, causes balls to remain at rest on the ground, and so much more.</p>
<p><strong><img src="Liftoff%20Challenges/Mechanics%20and%20Structures/Lux%20Blox/Marble%20Run/gravity_luxblox.png" alt="gravity" title="gravity" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="353" height="198" style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Friction</strong> is the force that causes objects to slow down when they rub against or slide past one another. Friction works against the motion of an object and acts in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>Gravity is the force that keeps the ball on the ramp. Friction is created by the ball moving over the surface of the ramp, and the ball eventually slows down.</p>
<p><strong><img src="Liftoff%20Challenges/Mechanics%20and%20Structures/Lux%20Blox/Marble%20Run/rolling-friction_luxblox.png" alt="rolling friction" title="rolling friction" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="431" height="242" style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></strong></p>
<p>Example: <em>Have you ever been sledding?</em> If so, then you experienced both gravity and friction at the same time. Gravity is the force that keeps you, the sled, and even the snow on the ground. When the sled slices through the snow, friction is created. The friction caused by the sled and surface of the snow is what causes the sled to slow down and stop.</p>

A ramp is an example of an inclined plane. Objects can be pushed up a ramp. They can also accelerate down a ramp. Forces are needed to move objects up or down a ramp.</p>

<p>The <strong>Engineering Design Process</strong> is the process used by engineers to develop and improve objects or systems. The process can be used to complete tasks such as designing cars and buildings. It can also be used to solve problems, build software, and complete many other projects.</p>
<p><img src="Liftoff%20Challenges/Mechanics%20and%20Structures/Lux%20Blox/Marble%20Run/ed-process_luxblox.png" alt="The Engineering Design Process" title="The Engineering Design Process" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%;"></p>
<h3>Standards, Limitations, and Models</h3>
<p>As engineers move through the engineering design process, they must consider the <strong>criteria</strong> and <strong>constraints</strong> of their project as they work on the <strong>prototype</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Criteria</strong> are the standards a design must meet in order to be successful.</li>
<li><strong>Constraints</strong> are the limitations placed on a design due to the availability of resources and environmental conditions.</li>
<li>A <strong>prototype</strong> is a model or pattern that is in progress for the project that is in the process of completion.</li>
</ol>
<p>Example: When working on a project, you will most likely have challenges, which engineers call criteria and constraints, that will be in place as you build a model. Imagine that you are building a new lift system that must include a screw. You must start building after 5 minutes, and there can only be four people in your group. In this case, your criteria is that the prototype must have a single screw in it. The constraints are the time and number of people in the build group.</p>

<p>Science and technology produce data. Every time you do an investigation, you collect data. Graphs give a visual image of that data.</p>
<p>Line plots are used to show how often something happens. This is a number line with circles or Xs above each number. This kind of graph is good for showing the lengths of similar objects, and counting how many have the same length.</p>
<p><img src="Liftoff%20Challenges/Mechanics%20and%20Structures/Lux%20Blox/Marble%20Run/LuxBlox_MarbleRun_PencilGraph_CLS.png" alt="Colored Pencils line plot example" title="Colored Pencils line plot example" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="447" height="364" style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>A bar graph uses bars to compare groups. The bars can stand for anything from types of animals to colors. The horizontal scale tells what the bar is. The numbers on the left tell how many. This scale counts by one. That means that each “box” in the bar shows one thing.</p>
<p><img src="Liftoff%20Challenges/Mechanics%20and%20Structures/Lux%20Blox/Marble%20Run/LuxBlox_CrayonGraph_CLS.png" alt="Color Crayon bar graph example" title="Color Crayon bar graph example" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="510" height="383" style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>A picture graph uses images, not bars.</p>
<p><img src="Liftoff%20Challenges/Mechanics%20and%20Structures/Lux%20Blox/Marble%20Run/LuxBlox_TransportationGraph_CLS.jpg" alt="Transportation picture graph example" title="Transportation picture graph example" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="593" height="334" style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>A scaled bar graph uses one block to show more than one thing. These graphs are good when there are large numbers of things, such as apples in an orchard or cars in a city. The time for a marble to go down a marble run could be 50 seconds. <em>Can you imagine how large your graph would be if each second was one square?</em> There would not be space to list all of the numbers!</p>
<p>Look at this example of a scaled bar graph. Each bar represents 10 seconds.</p>
<p><img src="Liftoff%20Challenges/Mechanics%20and%20Structures/Lux%20Blox/Marble%20Run/LuxBlox_ScaledGraph_CLS.jpg" alt="scaled graph example" title="scaled graph example" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%;"></p>
<p>All graphs should have the following parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>A title at the top that explains the data that was collected.</li>
<li>What was compared–Examples of this could be trials, days, designs, or the times the data was collected. This is listed at the bottom of the graph. It is called the “horizontal scale”. In line plots, this is the only scale used.</li>
<li>The unit of the data collected–This is on the left side of the graph. This is called the “vertical scale”.</li>
</ul>

<div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-8">
<p>The Olympic Games use timers for many events. Swimming and track athletes not only compete against each other but also for the best time. In the past, people used stopwatches to time the athletes. Now, they use touchpad digital timers and high-speed digital cameras.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the finish is very close. Then the officials have to look at single frames taken by the camera to see who won. In track, runners have little radio transmitters in their shoes. This technology helps check the winning times.</p>

<p>There is a special field of science called Horology. This is the study of time. People who make special clocks and watches are called Horologists. These people must understand how time is measured and the technology of how a clock works. Before there were digital clocks, clocks worked with gears. It took a lot of skill to make the gears work just right so that the clock measured time correctly.</p>
<p>Today, most clocks are digital. They can do more than tell time. A smart watch can answer a cell phone and get messages. It can also show how far you walk or how long you run. Some will even tell how many times a minute your heart beats.</p>
