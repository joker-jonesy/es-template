<ul>
<li><strong>Sequence </strong>- also known as the order of events</li>
<li><strong>Command </strong>- a specific action or instruction that tells the computer to do something</li>
<li><strong>Event </strong>- an interaction or change that can be identified by a computer or robot</li>
<li><strong>Sensor </strong>- a device that converts one type of signal to another (example: a tachometer displays the speed a car is traveling)</li>
<li><strong>Multiplicative Comparison </strong>- comparing two groups of objects using multiplication</li>
</ul>

<p>Robots need step-by-step instructions to do a job. They can only do what humans <strong>program</strong> them to do. A program tells a robot what to do, when to do it, and under what <strong>conditions</strong>. <strong>Conditionals</strong> are instructions that depend on whether something is true or false. Imagine we're writing a program to help us decide what to wear outside each day. If the temperature is at or below freezing, the program should warn us to wear a snow jacket.</p>

<p><strong>Sensors</strong> collect information called input. Robot sensors gather information from the surroundings and send it to the computer brick (or the brain of the robot). Robot sensors can only be used if the robot’s program asks for information from them! Similarly, the robot can only act on information from the sensors if its program tells it to do so! The sensors send information through the wires (similar to the nervous system in the human body) that connect them to the computer brick, which uses the information as long as its program requires it.</p>

<p><em>Did you know that multiplication can be represented as a comparison?</em> Think about the equation 5 x 3 = 15. <em>What does it mean? How can you draw a picture to show what it means?</em> You can draw an array, a number line, or equal groups as shown in the image below.</p>

<p><em>So then how can you represent multiplication as a comparison?</em> When showing multiplication as a comparison, you can use a tape diagram as shown below. <em>Can you describe what is happening in the image? What do you notice? What do you wonder? Can you see a comparison? Can you make up a story to match the image?</em></p>

<p>If a number story is comparing two things <strong>and</strong> uses phrases such as “times as many” or “times more,” it is a multiplicative comparison problem. Here are some examples of multiplicative comparison phrases:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have 3 <strong>times as many</strong> candles as my friend.</li>
<li>There are 5 <strong>times more</strong> red apples than green apples.</li>
<li>The blue ribbon costs 7 <strong>times as much</strong> as the red ribbon.</li>
<li>The column is 10 <strong>times as large</strong> as the brick.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1bg60dnfq2"><img src="CLS_Template/HQ%20Templates/CLS%20Icons%20-%20Explore%20-%20Color.png" alt="" title="" style="max-width: 100%;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" width="25" height="25"> <strong>How Can I Solve Multiplicative Comparison Problems?</strong></h2>
<p>To understand multiplication as a comparison, think about this number story: “I have five plants. My friend has three times as many plants. <em>How many plants does my friend have?”</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>What is being compared?</em> The number of plants that two people have is being compared.</li>
<li><em>What is the relationship between the number of plants?</em> One friend has 5 and the other friend has <strong>3 times as many</strong>. Notice that the story does <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> say, “the friend has 3 more plants.” If the friend had 3 more plants, then the relationship between the number of plants would be additive, and addition would be used to find the solution.</li>
<li><em>What does <strong>3 times as many</strong> plants mean?</em> Think about the image of the tape diagram. <em>How does the image show the idea of <strong>3 times as many</strong> plants?</em> The image shows that <strong>3 times as many</strong> plants means that the friend has 5 plants, 3 times. Because the 5 plants are repeated 3 times, multiplication can be used to find out the number of plants that the friend has. The friend has 15 plants.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this activity, you will take on the role of writer, producer, set designer, and director. Let’s take a look at how a set designer and a producer use math.</p>
<h3>Set Designer</h3>
<p>A set designer sketches and directs the building of sets for plays, television, and movies. A set designer would use multiplicative comparison when trying to figure out how much of a material is needed. For example, she may have 20 feet of wood to use but realizes that the space is 4 times as large as she thought. In this case, she would need to order 4 times as much wood to successfully build the set.</p>

<h3>Producer</h3>
<p>A producer is a person who finds the stories for movies or plays. They hire the cast and other people who will work on the film. One of their most important duties is to handle the budget. They use lots of math when tracking expenses and trying to stay on budget. Imagine if the budget was $5,000, but three times as much was actually spent. So, a producer would use many math calculations, including using multiplication as a comparison.</p>
